</div>

<p>The edition of the “Glories of Mary” now presented
to the Catholic public of America is the first
complete translation of the work ever made into the
English language. We trust that it will be found
to retain the spirit of the learned and saintly author,
and that it will be welcomed by the faithful in this
country with the same delight which it has universally
called forth in Catholic Europe.</p>

</div>

<p>In obedience to the decrees of Urban VIII., of holy
memory, I protest that I do not intend to attribute
any other than purely human authority to all the
miracles, revelations, graces, and incidents contained
in this book; neither to the titles holy or blessed applied
to the servants of God not yet canonized; except
in cases where these have been confirmed by the
holy Roman Catholic Church, and by the holy Apostolic
See, of whom I profess myself an obedient son;
and therefore to their judgment I submit myself and
whatever I have written in this book.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="PETITION_OF_THE_AUTHOR">PETITION OF THE AUTHOR TO JESUS AND MARY.</h2>

</div>

<p>My most loving Redeemer and Lord Jesus Christ,
I thy poor servant, knowing how pleasing to thee are
those who seek to glorify thy most holy mother,
whom thou lovest so much, and dost so much desire
to see loved and honored by all men, I propose to
publish this book of mine which treats of her glories.
I know not to whom I could commend it but to thee,
who hast so much at heart the glory of this mother.
To thee, then, I present and dedicate it. Receive this
little offering of my love for thee and thy beloved
mother. Take it under thy protection, and pour into
the hearts of those who read it the light of confidence
in this immaculate Virgin, and the warmth of a burning
love for her, in whom thou hast placed the hope
and refuge of all the redeemed. And for the reward
of this, my poor effort, give me, I pray thee, that love
for Mary with which I have desired to inflame, by
this my little work, the hearts of all those who read it.</p>

<p>To thee also I appeal, oh my sweetest Lady and
mother Mary. Thou knowest that in thee, next to
Jesus, I have placed all hope of my eternal salvation,
since all the good I have received, my conversion, my
vocation to leave the world, and whatever other graces
have been given me by God, I acknowledge them all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
as coming through thee. Thou knowest that to see
thee loved by all as thou dost deserve, and to offer thee
some token of gratitude, I have always sought to proclaim
thee everywhere, in public and in private, and to
inspire all men with a sweet and salutary devotion to
thee. I hope to continue to do so for the remainder
of my life, even to my last breath. But I see by my
advanced age and declining health that the end of my
pilgrimage and my entrance into eternity are drawing
near; therefore, I hope to give to the world, before
my death, this little book of mine which may continue
to proclaim thee for me, and also may excite others
to publish thy glories and the great mercy which thou
dost exercise towards thy devoted servants. I hope,
my most beloved queen, that this my poor offering,
although it falls so far short of thy merit, may be
pleasing to thy grateful heart, since it is wholly a gift
of love. Extend, then, that most kind hand of thine
with which thou hast delivered me from the world
and from hell, and accept it and protect it as belonging
to thee. But I ask this reward for my little offering,
that henceforth I may love thee more, and that
all into whose hands this work shall fall, may be inflamed
with thy love, so that immediately their desire
may increase to love thee, and see others love thee
also; and that they may engage with all ardor in
proclaiming and promoting, as far as possible, thy
praise, and confidence in thy most holy intercession.
Thus I hope, thus may it be.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="TO_THE_READER">TO THE READER.</h2>

</div>

<p>In order that this little work of mine may not be
exposed to censure from very fastidious critics, I have
thought it best to place in a clearer light some of the
propositions which it contains, and which may seem
too bold, or perhaps obscure. I here enumerate some
of them, and if others, my dear reader, should come
under your eye, I pray you to consider them as meant
and spoken by me according to the sense of true and
sound theology, and of the holy Roman Catholic
Church, whose obedient son I profess myself. In the
introduction, page 19, referring to chap. 5th of the
book, I have said that God has ordained that all
graces should come to us through the hands of Mary.
Now this is a very consoling truth for souls tenderly
attached to the most holy Mary, and for poor sinners
who desire to be converted. Nor should this appear
to any one inconsistent with sound theology, since its
author, St. Augustine, puts it forth as a general statement,
that Mary has shared, by means of her charity,
in the spiritual birth of all the members of the
Church.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span></p>

<p>A well-known author, whom no one will suspect of
exaggeration or of fanciful and overheated devotion,
adds, that as Jesus Christ really formed his Church on
Calvary, it is plain that the holy Virgin really co-operated
with him, in a peculiar and excellent manner,
in its formation.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> And for the same reason it may
be said, that if she brought forth Jesus Christ, the
head of the Church, without pain, she did not bring
forth the body of this head without pain. Hence she
commenced on Calvary to be, in a particular manner,
mother of the whole Church. To say all in a few
words, Almighty God, in order to glorify the mother
of the Redeemer, has ordained that her great charity
should intercede for all those for whom her divine
Son offered and paid the superabundant ransom of
his precious blood, in which alone is our <i>salvation</i>, <i>life</i>,
and <i>resurrection</i>. It is on the basis of this doctrine
and whatever belongs to it that I have undertaken to
establish my propositions,<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> which the saints in their
affecting colloquies with Mary, and in their fervent
discourses concerning her, have not hesitated to assert:
whence an ancient father, quoted by the celebrated
Vincenzo Contensone, has written: The fulness of
grace was in Christ as the head from which it flows,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
but in Mary as the neck through which it is transmitted.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
This is plainly taught by the angelic Doctor,
St. Thomas, who confirms all the foregoing in these
words: The blessed Virgin is called full of grace in
three ways.... The third, in reference to its
overflowing upon all men. For great is it in each
saint if he hath enough of grace for the salvation of
many; but this would be the greatest, if he had
enough for the salvation of all men; and it is so with
Christ and the blessed Virgin, for in every danger we
may obtain salvation through the glorious Virgin.
Hence, cant. 4, v. 4, <i>a thousand bucklers</i>—that is,
remedies against dangers—<i>hang upon her</i>; “Mille
clypei pendent ex ea.” Hence in every virtuous work
we can have her aid, and, therefore, she herself says,
In me is all hope of life and of virtue: “<i>In me omnis
spes vitæ et virtutis.</i>”<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>—Eccli. xxiv. 25.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION<br>
<span class="smaller">WHICH OUGHT TO BE READ.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>My dear reader and brother in Mary, since the devotion
which has urged me to write, and now moves you
to read this book, renders us both happy children of
this good mother, if you ever should hear any one say
that I could have spared this labor, there being so
many learned and celebrated books that treat of this
subject, answer him, I pray you, in the words of Francone
the abbot, which we find in the Library of the
Fathers, that the praise of Mary is a fountain so full
that the more it extends, the fuller it becomes, and the
fuller it becomes the more it extends;<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> which signifies,
that the blessed Virgin is so great and sublime, that the
more we praise her, the more there is to praise. So
that St. Augustine says: All the tongues of men,
even if all their members were changed to tongues,
would not be sufficient to praise her as she deserves.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span></p>

<p>I know that there are innumerable books, both great
and small, which treat of the glories of Mary; but as
these are rare or voluminous, and not according to my
plan, I have endeavored to collect in a small space,
from all the authors at my command, the most select
and pithy sentences of the Fathers and theologians, in
order to give devout persons an opportunity, with little
effort or expense, to inflame their ardor by reading of
the love of Mary, and especially to present materials to
priests which may enable them to excite by their sermons
devotion to the divine mother.</p>

<p>Worldly lovers are accustomed to mention frequently
and to praise the persons beloved, that these may be
praised and applauded also by others; then how poor
must we suppose the love of those to be who boast of
being lovers of Mary, but who seldom remember to
speak of her, and inspire the love of her also in others!
Not so the true lovers of our most lovely Lady: they
would praise her everywhere, and see her loved by all
the world; and therefore in public and in private, wherever
it is in their power, they endeavor to kindle in
the hearts of all, those blessed flames of love with
which theirs are burning for their beloved queen.</p>

<p>But that every one may be persuaded of how great
benefit it is to himself and the people to promote devotion
to Mary, let us hear what the Fathers say of it.
St. Bonaventure declares that those who are devoted to
publishing the glories of Mary, are secure of paradise;
and Richard of St. Laurence confirms this by saying,
that to honor the queen of angels is to acquire life<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
everlasting;<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> since our most grateful Lady, adds the same
author, pledges herself to honor in the other life him
who promises to honor her in this;<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> and is there any
one ignorant of the promise made by Mary herself to
those who engage in promoting the knowledge and
love of her upon the earth? “They that explain me
shall have life everlasting,”<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> as the holy Church applies
it on the festival of her Immaculate Conception. Exult,
exult! oh my soul! said St. Bonaventure, who was so
assiduous in proclaiming the praises of Mary, and
rejoice in her, because many good things are prepared
for those who praise her; and since all the Holy Scriptures,
he added, speak in praise of Mary, let us endeavor
always with heart and tongue to celebrate this our divine
mother, that we may be conducted by her to the
kingdom of the blessed.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>We are told in the revelations of St. Bridget, that the
blessed Emingo, Bishop, being accustomed to begin his
sermons with the praises of Mary, the Virgin herself
appeared one day to the saint, and said to her, “Tell
that prelate who is accustomed to commence his discourses
with my praises, that I will be his mother, and
that I will present his soul to God, and that he shall die<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
a good death;”<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> and he indeed died like a saint, in
prayer and in celestial peace. Mary appeared before
his death to another religious, a Dominican, who was
accustomed to terminate his sermons by speaking of
her. She defended him from the assaults of the demons,
comforted him, and bore away with her his happy
soul.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> The devout Thomas à Kempis represents Mary
as commending to her Son those who publish her
praises, and saying, “Oh, my Son, have compassion on
the souls of thy lovers, and of those who speak in my
praise.”<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>As far as the advantage of the people is concerned,
St. Anselm says, that the sacred womb of Mary
having been made the way of salvation for sinners,
sinners cannot but be converted and saved by discourses
in praise of Mary.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> If the assertion is true
and incontrovertible, as I believe it to be, and as I
shall prove, in the fifth chapter of this book, that all
graces are dispensed by the hand of Mary alone, and
that all those who are saved, are saved solely by
means of this divine mother; it may be said, as a necessary
consequence, that the salvation of all depends
upon preaching Mary, and confidence in her intercession.
We know that St. Bernard of Sienna sanctified<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
Italy; St. Dominic converted many provinces; St.
Louis Bertrand, in all his sermons, never failed to exhort
his hearers to practise devotion towards Mary;
and many others also have done the same.</p>

<p>I find that Father Paul Segneri, the younger, a celebrated
missionary, in every mission preached a sermon
on devotion to Mary, and this he called his favorite
sermon. And we can attest, in all truth, that in our
missions, where we have an invariable rule not to omit
the sermon on our Lady, no discourse is so profitable
to the people, or excites more compunction among
them, than that on the mercy of Mary. I say <i>on the
mercy of Mary</i>: for St. Bernard says, we may praise
her humility, and marvel at her virginity; but being
poor sinners, we are more pleased and attracted by
hearing of her mercy; for to this we more affectionately
cling, this we more often remember and invoke.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
Therefore in this little book, leaving to other authors
the description of the other merits of Mary, I have confined
myself especially to treating of her great compassion
and her powerful intercession; having collected, as
far as possible, with the labor of years, all that the
holy Fathers and the most celebrated authors have
said of the mercy and power of Mary; and because
these attributes of the blessed Virgin are wonderfully
set forth in the great prayer of the <i>Salve Regina</i>, approved
by the Church, and required by her to be recited<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
the greater part of the year by all the clergy,
secular and regular, I have undertaken, in the first
place, to explain in separate discourses this most devout
prayer. Besides this, I believed it would be
acceptable to the servants of Mary, if I added discourses
on her principal festivals and upon the virtues
of our divine mother, placing at the conclusion of
them the practices of devotion most in use among her
servants, and approved by the Church.</p>

<p>Devout reader, if this little work of mine pleases
you, as I hope it will, I pray you to commend me to
the holy Virgin, that I may obtain great confidence
in her protection. Ask for me this grace, and I will
ask the same for you, whoever you may be, who bestow
on me this charity. Oh, blessed is he who
clings with love and confidence to those two anchors
of salvation, Jesus and Mary! He certainly will not
be lost. Let us both say, oh my reader, with the devout
Alphonso Rodriguez: Jesus and Mary, my sweet
loves, for you I will suffer, for you I will die; may I
be wholly yours, may I be in nothing my own.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> May
we love Jesus and Mary, and become saints, since we
can aspire and hope for no greater happiness than this.
Farewell, till we meet in heaven at the feet of this
sweet mother and her dearly beloved Son, to praise
them, to thank them, and love them, in their immediate
presence through all eternity. Amen.</p>

<p>Oh Mary, sweet refuge of miserable sinners, at the

</div>

<h4 id="CHAPTER_I_SECTION_I">SECTION I.<br>
OF THE GREAT CONFIDENCE WE SHOULD HAVE IN MARY, BECAUSE
SHE IS THE QUEEN OF MERCY.</h4>

<p>The Holy Church justly honors the great Virgin
Mary, and would have her honored by all men with
the glorious title of queen, because she has been elevated
to the dignity of mother of the King of kings.
If the Son is king, says St. Athanasius, his mother
must necessarily be considered and entitled queen.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
From the moment that Mary consented, adds St. Bernardine
of Sienna, to become the mother of the Eternal
Word, she merited the title of queen of the world and
of all creatures.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> If the flesh of Mary, says St. Arnold,
abbot, was the flesh of Jesus, how can the
mother be separated from the Son in his kingdom?
Hence it follows that the regal glory must not only be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
considered as common to the mother and the Son, but
even the same.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>If Jesus is king of the whole world, Mary is also
queen of the whole world:<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> therefore, says St. Bernardine
of Sienna, all creatures who serve God ought
also to serve Mary; for all angels and men, and all
things that are in heaven and on earth being subject
to the dominion of God, are also subject to the dominion
of the glorious Virgin.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> Hence Guerric, abbot,
thus addresses the divine mother: Continue, Mary,
continue in security to reign; dispose, according to thy
will, of every thing belonging to thy Son, for thou,
being mother and spouse of the king of the world, the
kingdom and power over all creatures is due to thee
as queen.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>Mary, then, is queen; but let all learn for their consolation
that she is a mild and merciful queen, desiring
the good of us poor sinners. Hence the holy Church<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
bids us salute her in this prayer, and name her the
<i>Queen of Mercy</i>. The very name of queen signifies,
as blessed Albertus Magnus remarks, compassion, and
provision for the poor; differing in this from the title
of empress, which signifies severity and rigor. The
greatness of kings and queens consists in comforting
the wretched, as Seneca says.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> So that whereas tyrants,
in reigning, have only their own advantage in
view, kings should have for their object the good of
their subjects. Therefore at the consecration of kings
their heads are anointed with oil, which is the symbol
of mercy, to denote that they, in reigning, should above
all things cherish thoughts of kindness and beneficence
towards their subjects.</p>

<p>Kings should then principally occupy themselves
with works of mercy, but not to the neglect of the exercise
of justice towards the guilty, when it is required.
Not so Mary, who, although queen, is not queen of
justice, intent upon the punishment of the guilty, but
queen of mercy, solely intent upon compassion and
pardon for sinners. Accordingly, the Church requires
us explicitly to call her queen of mercy. The High
Chancellor of Paris, John Gerson, meditating on the
words of David, “These two things have I heard, that
power belongeth to God, and mercy to thee, O Lord,”<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>
says, that the kingdom of God consisting of justice
and mercy, the Lord has divided it; he has reserved<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
the kingdom of justice for himself, and he has granted
the kingdom of mercy to Mary, ordaining that all the
mercies which are dispensed to men should pass
through the hands of Mary, and should be bestowed
according to her good pleasure.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> St. Thomas confirms
this in his preface to the Canonical Epistles,
saying that the holy Virgin, when she conceived the
divine Word in her womb, and brought him forth,
obtained the half of the kingdom of God by becoming
queen of mercy, Jesus Christ remaining king
of justice.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>The eternal Father constituted Jesus Christ king
of justice, and therefore made him the universal judge
of the world; hence the prophet sang: “Give to the
king thy judgment, Oh God; and to the king’s son
thy justice.”<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> Here a learned interpreter takes up
the subject, and says: Oh Lord, thou hast given to
thy Son thy justice, because thou hast given to the
mother of the king thy mercy.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> And St. Bonaventure
happily varies the passage above quoted by saying:
Give to the king thy judgment, Oh God, and to his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
mother thy mercy.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> Ernest, Archbishop of Prague,
also says, that the eternal Father has given to the
Son the office of judging and punishing, and to the
mother the office of compassionating and relieving the
wretched.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> Therefore the Prophet David predicted
that God himself, if I may thus express it,
would consecrate Mary queen of mercy, anointing her
with the oil of gladness,<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> in order that all of us miserable
children of Adam might rejoice in the thought
of having in heaven that great queen, so full of the
unction of mercy and pity for us; as St. Bonaventure
says: Oh Mary, so full of the unction of mercy and
the oil of pity, that God has anointed thee with the
oil of gladness!<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>And how well does blessed Albertus Magnus here
apply the history of Queen Esther, who was indeed a
type of our Queen Mary! We read in the 4th chap.
of the Book of Esther, that in the reign of King Assuerus,
there went forth, throughout his kingdom, a decree
commanding the death of all the Jews. Then
Mardochai, who was one of the condemned, committed
their cause to Esther, that she might intercede with
the king to obtain the revocation of the sentence. At
first Esther refused to take upon herself this office,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
fearing that it would excite the anger of the king
more. But Mardochai rebuked her, and bade her remember
that she must not think of saving herself
alone, as the Lord had placed her upon the throne to
obtain salvation for all the Jews: “Think not that
thou mayest save thy life only, because thou art in the
king’s house, more than all the Jews.”<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> Thus said
Mardochai to Queen Esther, and thus might we poor
sinners say to our Queen Mary, if she were ever reluctant
to intercede with God for our deliverance from
the just punishment of our sins. Think not that thou
mayest save thy life only, because thou art in the
king’s house, more than all men. Think not, oh
Lady, that God has exalted thee to be queen of the
world, only to secure thy own welfare; but also that
thou, being so greatly elevated, mayest the more compassionate
and the better relieve us miserable sinners.</p>

<p>Assuerus, when he saw Esther before him, affectionately
inquired of her what she had come to ask of
him: “What is thy petition?” Then the queen answered,
“If I have found favor in thy sight, oh
king, give me my people for which I request.”<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> Assuerus
heard her, and immediately ordered the sentence
to be revoked. Now, if Assuerus granted to
Esther, because he loved her, the salvation of the Jews,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
will not God graciously listen to Mary, in his boundless
love for her, when she prays to him for those
poor sinners who recommend themselves to her and
says to him: If I have found favor in thy sight, oh
King, my King and my God, if I have ever found
favor with Thee (and well does the divine mother
know herself to be the blessed, the fortunate, the only
one of the children of men who found the grace lost
by man; she knows herself to be the beloved of her
Lord, more beloved than all the saints and angels
united), give me my people for which I request: if
thou lovest me, she says to him, give me, oh my Lord,
these sinners in whose behalf I entreat Thee. Is it
possible that God will not graciously hear her? Is
there any one who does not know the power of Mary’s
prayers with God? The law of clemency is on her
tongue.<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> Every prayer of hers is as a law established
by our Lord, that mercy shall be exercised towards
those for whom Mary intercedes. St. Bernard asks,
Why does the Church name Mary <i>Queen of Mercy</i>?
and answers, Because we believe that she opens the
depths of the mercy of God, to whom she will, when
she will, and as she will; so that not even the vilest
sinner is lost, if Mary protects him.<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>But it may, perhaps, be feared that Mary disdains<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
interposing in behalf of some sinners, because she
finds them so laden with sins? Perhaps the majesty
and sanctity of this great queen should alarm us?
No, says St. Gregory, in proportion to her greatness
and holiness are her clemency and mercy towards
sinners who desire to amend, and who have recourse
to her.<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> Kings and queens inspire terror by the display
of their majesty, and their subjects fear to enter
their presence; but what fear, says St. Bernard, can
the wretched have of going to this queen of mercy,
since she never shows herself terrible or austere to
those who seek her, but all sweetness and kindness?<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>
Mary not only gives, but she herself presents to us
milk and wool: the milk of mercy to inspire us with
confidence, and wool to shield us from the thunderbolts
of divine justice!</p>

<p>Suetonius narrates of the Emperor Titus, that he
never could refuse a favor to any one who asked it,
and that he even sometimes promised more than he
could perform; and he answered to one who admonished
him of this, that a prince should not dismiss any
one from his presence dissatisfied. Titus said this, but,
in reality, was perhaps often either guilty of falsehood,
or failed in his promises. But our queen cannot lie,
and can obtain whatever she wishes for her devoted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
servants. She has a heart so kind and compassionate,
says Blosius, that she cannot send away dissatisfied
any one who invokes her aid.<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> But, as St. Bernard
says, how couldst thou, oh Mary, refuse succor to the
wretched, when thou art queen of mercy? and who
are the subjects of mercy, if not the miserable? Thou
art the queen of mercy, and I the most miserable of
all sinners; if I, then, am the first of thy subjects, then
thou shouldst have more care of me than of all
others.<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>Have pity on us, then, oh queen of mercy, and give
heed to our salvation; neither say to us, oh most holy
Virgin, as St. Gregory of Nicomedia would add, that
thou canst not aid us because of the multitude of our
sins, when thou hast such power and pity that no
number of sins can ever surpass it! Nothing resists
thy power, since thy Creator and ours, while he honors
thee as his mother, considers thy glory as his own, and
exulting in it, as a Son, grants thy petitions as if he
were discharging an obligation.<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> By this he means to
say, that though Mary is under an infinite obligation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
to her Son for having elected her to be his mother,
yet it cannot be denied that the Son also is greatly
indebted to his mother for having given him his human
nature; whence Jesus, as if to recompense Mary
as he ought, while he enjoys this his glory, honors
her especially by always graciously listening to her
prayers.</p>

<p>How great then should be our confidence in this
queen, knowing how powerful she is with God, and
at the same time how rich and full of mercy; so much
so that there is no one on earth who does not share
in the mercies and favors of Mary! This the blessed
Virgin herself revealed to St. Bridget: “I am,” she
said to her, “the queen of heaven and the mother of
mercy; I am the joy of the just, and the gate of entrance
for sinners to God; neither is there living on
earth a sinner who is so accursed that he is deprived
of my compassion; for every one, if he receives nothing
else through my intercession, receives the grace
of being less tempted by evil spirits than he otherwise
would be; no one, therefore,” she added, “who is
not entirely accursed” (by which is meant the final
and irrevocable malediction pronounced against the
damned), “is so entirely cast off by God that he may
not return and enjoy his mercy if he invokes my aid.
I am called by all the mother of mercy, and truly the
mercy of God towards men has made me so merciful
towards them.” And then she concluded by saying,
“Therefore he shall be miserable, and forever miserable
in another life, who in this, being able, does not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
have recourse to me, who am so compassionate to
all, and so earnestly desire to aid sinners.”<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>Let us then have recourse, let us always have recourse
to this most sweet queen, if we would be sure
of our salvation; and if the sight of our sins terrifies
and disheartens us, let us remember that Mary was
made queen of mercy for this very end, that she might
save by her protection the greatest and most abandoned
sinners who have recourse to her. They are
to be her crown in heaven, as her divine spouse has
said: “Come from Libanus, my spouse, come from
Libanus, come; thou shalt be crowned from the dens
of the lions, from the mountains of the leopards.”<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>
And what are these dens of wild beasts and monsters,
if not miserable sinners, whose souls become dens of
sins, the most deformed monsters? Now, by these
same sinners, as Rupert, the abbot, remarks, who are
saved by thy means, oh great Queen Mary, thou wilt
be crowned in heaven; for their salvation will be thy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
crown, a crown indeed worthy and fit for a queen of
mercy;<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> and let the following example illustrate this.</p>

<h5>EXAMPLE.</h5>

<p>We read in the life of sister Catherine, an Augustinian
nun, that in the place where that servant of God
lived, there lived also a woman named Mary, who, in
her youth, was a sinner, and obstinately persevered in
her evil courses, even to extreme old age. For this
she was banished by her fellow-citizens, forced to live
in a cave beyond the limits of the place, and died in
a state of loathsome corruption, abandoned by all, and
without the sacraments; and on this account was
buried in a field, like a beast. Now sister Catherine,
who was accustomed to recommend very affectionately
to God the souls of those who had departed this
life, after learning the miserable death of this poor old
woman, did not think of praying for her, as she and
every one else believed her already among the damned.
Four years having past, a soul from purgatory one
day appeared to her, and said, “Sister Catherine, how
unhappy is my fate! you commend to God the souls
of all those who die, and for my soul alone you have
had no pity.” “And who are you?” said the servant
of God. “I am,” answered she, “that poor Mary
who died in the cave.” “How! are you saved?”
exclaimed sister Catherine. “Yes, I am saved,” she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
said, “by the mercy of the Virgin Mary.” “And
how?” “When I saw death drawing near, finding
myself laden with sins, and abandoned by all, I turned
to the mother of God and said to her, Lady, thou art
the refuge of the abandoned, behold me at this hour
deserted by all; thou art my only hope, thou alone
canst help me; have pity on me. The holy Virgin
obtained for me the grace of making an act of contrition;
I died and am saved, and my queen has also
obtained for me the grace that my pains should be
abridged, and that I should, by suffering intensely for a
short time, pass through that purification which otherwise
would have lasted many years. A few masses
only are needed to obtain my release from purgatory;
I pray thee cause them to be offered for me, and I
promise to pray God and Mary for thee.” Sister
Catherine immediately caused those masses to be said
for her, and that soul, after a few days, appeared to
her again, more brilliant than the sun, and said to her,
“I thank thee, sister Catherine: behold, I am now
going to paradise to sing the mercy of God and pray
for thee.”</p>

<h5>PRAYER.</h5>

<p>Oh Mother of my God and my Lady Mary, as a poor
wounded and loathsome wretch presents himself to a
great queen, I present myself to thee, who art the
queen of heaven and earth. From the lofty throne
on which thou art seated, do not disdain, I pray thee,
to cast thy eyes upon me, a poor sinner. God hath<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
made thee so rich in order that thou mayest succor
the needy, and hath made thee queen of mercy that
thou mayest help the miserable, look upon me, then,
and have pity on me. Look upon me, and do not
leave me until thou hast changed me from a sinner
into a saint. I see I merit nothing, or rather I merit
for my ingratitude to be deprived of all the graces
which, by thy means, I have received from the Lord.
But thou, who art the mother of mercy, dost not require
merits, but miseries, that thou mayest succor
those who are in need; and who is more poor and
more needy than I?</p>

<p>Oh glorious Virgin, I know that thou, being queen
of the universe, art also my queen; and I, in a more
especial manner, would dedicate myself to thy service;
that thou mayest dispose of me as seemeth
best to thee. Therefore I say to thee with St. Bonaventure,
Oh, Lady, I submit myself to thy control,
that thou mayest rule and govern me entirely.
Do not leave me to myself.<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> Rule me, oh my queen,
and do not leave me to myself. Command me, employ
me as thou wilt, and punish me if I do not obey
thee, for very salutary will be the punishments that
come from thy hand. I would esteem it a greater
thing to be thy servant than Lord of the whole earth.
<i>Thine I am, save me!</i><a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> Accept me, oh Mary, for thy
own, and attend to my salvation, as I am thine own.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
I no longer will be my own, I give myself to thee.
And if hitherto I have so poorly served thee, having
lost so many good occasions of honoring thee, for the
time to come I will unite myself to thy most loving
and most faithful servants. No one from this time
henceforth shall surpass me in honoring and loving
thee, my most lovely queen. This I promise, and
this I hope to perform with thy assistance. Amen.</p>

<h4 id="CHAPTER_I_SECTION_II">SECTION II.<br>
HOW MUCH GREATER SHOULD BE OUR CONFIDENCE IN MARY BECAUSE
SHE IS OUR MOTHER.</h4>

<p>Not by chance, nor in vain, do the servants of
Mary call her mother, and it would seem that they
cannot invoke her by any other name, and are never
weary of calling her mother; mother, indeed, for she
is truly our mother, not according to the flesh, but
the spiritual mother of our souls and of our salvation.
Sin, when it deprived our souls of divine grace, also
deprived them of life. Hence, when they were dead
in misery and sin, Jesus our Redeemer came with an
excess of mercy and love to restore to us, by his death
upon the cross, that lost life, as he has himself declared:
“I am come that they may have life, and may
have it more abundantly.”<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> <i>More abundantly</i>, because,
as the theologians teach us, Jesus Christ by his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
redemption brought us blessings greater than the injury
Adam inflicted upon us by his sin; he reconciled
us to God, and thus became the father of our souls,
under the new law of grace, as the prophet Isaiah
predicted: “The Father of the world to come, the
Prince of peace.”<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> But if Jesus is the father of our
souls, Mary is the mother; for, in giving us Jesus, she
gave us the true life; and offering upon Calvary the
life of her Son for our salvation, she then brought us
forth to the life of divine grace.</p>

<p>At two different times, then, as the holy Fathers
show us, Mary became our spiritual mother; the first
when she was found worthy of conceiving in her virginal
womb the Son of God, as the blessed Albertus
Magnus says.</p>

<p>St. Bernardine of Sienna more distinctly teaches us
that when the most holy Virgin, on the annunciation
of the angel, gave her consent to become mother of
the eternal Word, which he awaited before making
himself her Son, she by this consent even from that
time demanded of God, with lively affection, our salvation;
and she was so earnestly engaged in obtaining
it, that from that time she has borne us, as it were,
in her womb, as a most loving mother.<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span></p>

<p>St. Luke says, speaking of the birth of our Saviour,
that Mary “brought forth her first-born son.”<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>
Therefore, says a certain writer, if the evangelist affirms
that Mary brought forth her first-born, is it to
be supposed that she afterwards had other children?
But the same author adds: If it is of faith that Mary
had no other children according to the flesh except
Jesus, then she must have other spiritual children, and
these we are.<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> Our Lord revealed this to St. Gertrude,
who, reading one day the passage of the Gospel
just quoted, was troubled, not knowing how to
understand it, that Mary being mother of Jesus Christ
alone, it could be said that he was her first-born.
And God explained it to her, by telling her that Jesus
was her first-born according to the flesh, but that men
were her second-born according to the spirit.</p>

<p>And this explains what is said of Mary in the holy
Canticles: “Thy belly is as a heap of wheat, set about
with lilies.”<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> St. Ambrose explains this and says: Although
in the pure womb of Mary there was only one
grain of wheat, which was Jesus Christ, yet it is called
a heap of grain, because in that one grain were contained
all the elect, of whom Mary was to be the
mother.<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> Hence, William the Abbot wrote, Mary,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
in bringing forth Jesus, who is our Saviour and
our life, brought forth all of us to life and salvation.<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p>The second time in which Mary brought us forth to
grace was, when on Calvary, she offered to the eternal
Father with so much sorrow of heart the life of her
beloved Son for our salvation. Wherefore, St. Augustine
asserts, that, having then co-operated by her
love with Christ in the birth of the faithful to the life
of grace, she became also by this co-operation the
spiritual mother of us all, who are members of our
head, Jesus Christ.<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> This is also the meaning of what
is said of the blessed Virgin in the sacred Canticles:
“They have made me the keeper in the vineyards;
my vineyard I have not kept.”<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> Mary, to save our
souls, was willing to sacrifice the life of her Son,<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> as
William the Abbot remarks. And who was the soul
of Mary, but her Jesus, who was her life and all her
love? Wherefore St. Simeon announced to her that
her soul would one day be pierced by a sword of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
sorrow;<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> which was the very spear that pierced the
side of Jesus, who was the soul of Mary. And then
she in her sorrow brought us forth to eternal life; so
that we may all call ourselves children of the dolors
of Mary. She, our most loving mother, was always
and wholly united to the divine will; whence St. Bonaventure
remarks, that when she saw the love of the
eternal Father for men, who would have his Son die
for our salvation, and the love of the Son in wishing to
die for us, she too, with her whole will, offered her
Son and consented that he should die that we might
be saved, in order to conform herself to that exceeding
love of the Father and Son for the human race.<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>It is true that, in dying for the redemption of the
world, Jesus wished to be alone. I have trodden the
wine-press alone,<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> “Torcular calcavi solus.” But when
God saw the great desire of Mary to devote herself
also to the salvation of men, he ordained that by the
sacrifice and offering of the life of this same Jesus, she
might co-operate with him in the work of our salvation,
and thus become mother of our souls. And this
our Saviour signified, when, before expiring, he saw
from the cross his mother and the disciple St. John
both standing near him, and first spoke to Mary:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
Behold thy son, “Ecce filius tuus;”<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> as if he said to
her: Behold the man who, by the offering thou hast
made of my life for his salvation, is already born to
grace. And then turning to the disciple, he said:
Behold thy mother, “Ecce mater tua.”<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> By which
words, says St. Bernardine of Sienna, Mary was then
made mother not only of St. John, but of all men,
for the love she bore them.<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> On this account, as
Silveira observes, St. John himself, when recording
this fact in his Gospel, wrote, “After that he said to
the disciple: “Behold thy mother.”<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> Let it be remarked
that Jesus Christ did not say this to John,
but to the disciple, to signify that the Saviour appointed
Mary for common mother of all those who,
being Christians, bear the name of his disciples.<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p>I am the mother of fair love,<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> “Ego sum mater
pulchræ dilectionis,” said Mary; because her love, as
an author remarks, which renders the souls of men
beautiful in the eye of God, prompts her, as a loving
mother, to receive us for her children.<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> And as a
mother loves her children, and watches over their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
welfare, so thou, oh our most sweet queen, lovest us,
and dost procure our happiness, says St. Bonaventure.<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p>Oh, happy those who live under the protection of
a mother so loving and so powerful! The prophet
David, although Mary was not yet born, besought of
God salvation, by dedicating himself to Mary as her
son, and thus prayed: “Save the son of thy handmaid.”<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>
“Whose handmaid?” asks St. Augustine:<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>
“she who says: Behold the handmaid of the Lord.”<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>
And who, says the Cardinal Bellarmine, who would
dare to snatch these children from the bosom of Mary,
where they have taken refuge from their enemies?
What fury of hell or of passion can conquer them, if
they place their trust in the protection of this great
mother?<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> It is narrated of the whale, that when she
sees her young in peril, from the tempest or their pursuers,
she opens her mouth and receives them into her
bowels. Just so, says Novarino, does this compassionate
mother of the faithful, when the tempest of the
passions is raging. She then, with maternal affection,
protects them as it were in her own bowels, and continues
to shelter them until she has placed them in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
secure haven of paradise.<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> Oh, most loving mother!
Oh, most compassionate mother, be ever blessed! and
may that God be ever blessed, who has given us thee
as a mother, and as a secure refuge in all the dangers
of this life. The blessed Virgin herself revealed this
to St. Bridget, saying: “As a mother who sees her son
exposed to the sword of the enemy, makes every
effort to save him, thus do I, and will I ever do
for my children, sinful though they be, if they come
to me for help.”<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> Behold, then, how in every battle
with hell we shall always conquer, and certainly conquer,
if we have recourse to the mother of God and
our mother, always repeating: “We fly to thy protection,
oh holy mother of God; we fly to thy protection,
oh holy mother of God.”<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> Oh, how many
victories have the faithful obtained over hell, by having
recourse to Mary with this short but powerful prayer!
That great servant of God, sister Mary of the Crucifixion,
a Benedictine nun, by this means always conquered
the evil spirits.</p>

<p>Be joyful, then, all ye children of Mary; remember
that she adopts as her children all those who wish her
for their mother. Joyful; for what fear have you of
being lost when this mother defends and protects you?<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
Thus says St. Bonaventure: Every one who loves this
good mother and trusts in her protection, should take
courage and repeat: What do you fear, oh my soul?
The cause of thy eternal salvation will not be lost, as
the final sentence depends upon Jesus, who is thy
brother, and upon Mary, who is thy mother.<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> And
St. Anselm, full of joy at this thought, exclaims, in
order to encourage us: Oh, blessed confidence! Oh,
secure refuge! The mother of God is my mother
also. With what certainty may we hope, since our
salvation depends upon the sentence of a good brother
and of a kind mother!<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> Hear, then, our mother who
calls us, and says to us: “Whosoever is a little one,
let him come to me.”<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> Little children have always on
their lips the word mother, and in all the dangers to
which they are exposed, and in all their fears, they
cry, mother, mother! Ah, most sweet Mary! Ah,
most loving mother! this is exactly what thou dost
desire; that we become little children, and always call
upon thee in our dangers, and always have recourse to
thee, for thou wishest to aid and save us, as thou hast
saved all thy children who have had recourse to
thee.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span></p>

<h5>EXAMPLE.</h5>

<p>In the history of the foundations of the Company
of Jesus, in the kingdom of Naples, is related the following
story of a noble youth of Scotland, named
William Elphinstone. He was a relation of King
James. Born a heretic, he followed the false sect to
which he belonged; but enlightened by divine grace,
which showed him his errors, he went to France,
where, with the assistance of a good Jesuit father, who
was like himself a Scotchman, and still more by the
intercession of the blessed Virgin, he at length saw the
truth, abjured heresy, and became a Catholic. He
went afterwards to Rome, where a friend of his found
him one day very much afflicted, and weeping. He
asked him the cause, and he answered, that in the
night his mother had appeared to him and said: “My
son, it is well for thee that thou hast entered the true
Church; I am already lost, because I died in heresy.”
From that time he became more fervent in his devotion
to Mary, chose her for his mother, and by her
was inspired to become a religious. He made a vow
to do so, but being ill, he went to Naples to restore
his health by a change of air. But the Lord ordered
it so that he should die in Naples, and die a religious;
for, having become dangerously ill soon after
his arrival there, he by prayers and tears obtained from
the superiors admittance, and when about receiving
the viaticum, he made his vows in presence of the
blessed sacrament, and was enrolled in the society.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
After this, in the tenderness of his feelings, he gave
thanks to his mother Mary for having rescued him
from heresy, and brought him to die in the true
Church, and in a religious house in the midst of his
brethren. Therefore, he exclaimed: “Oh! how glorious
it is to die in the midst of so many angels!”
Being exhorted to take a little rest, he answered: “Ah,
this is not the time to rest when the end of my life is
drawing near.” Before dying, he said to the persons
present: “Brethren, do you not see the angels of
heaven around me?” One of the religious having
heard him murmuring something to himself, asked him
what he had said. He answered, that his angel-guardian
had revealed to him that he should be in purgatory
but a short time, and would soon enter paradise.
Then he began again to talk with his sweet mother
Mary, and repeating the word, mother, mother, he
tranquilly expired, like a child falling asleep in the
arms of its mother. Soon after, it was revealed to a
devout religious that he had already entered paradise.</p>

<h5>PRAYER.</h5>

<p>Oh, my most holy mother, how is it possible that,
having so holy a mother, I should be so wicked? A
mother so inflamed with love to God, and that I
should so love creatures? A mother so rich in virtue,
and that I should be so poor? Oh, my most
amiable mother! I no longer deserve, it is true, to be
thy son, because by my bad life I have rendered myself
unworthy. I am content if thou wilt accept me as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
thy servant. I am ready to renounce all the kingdoms
of the earth, to be admitted among the lowest
of thy servants. Yes, I am content, but do not forbid
me to call thee my mother. This name wholly
consoles me, melts me, and reminds me of my obligation
to love thee. This name encourages me to confide
in thee. When I am the most terrified at the
thought of my sins and of the divine justice, I feel
myself comforted by the remembrance that thou art
my mother. Permit me, then, to call thee my mother,
my sweetest mother. Thus I call thee, and thus I will
ever call thee. Thou, next to God, shalt always be
my hope, my refuge, and my love, in this valley of
tears. And thus I hope to die, commending my soul,
at the last moment, into thy sacred hands, saying:
“My mother, my mother Mary, help me, have pity
on me.” Amen.</p>

<h4 id="CHAPTER_I_SECTION_III">SECTION III.<br>
HOW GREAT IS THE LOVE OF OUR MOTHER FOR US.</h4>

<p>If, then, Mary is our mother, let us consider how
much she loves us. The love of parents for their
children is a necessary love, and for this reason, as St.
Thomas observes,<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> children are commanded in the
divine law to love their parents; but there is no command,
on the other hand, given to parents to love<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
their children, for love towards one’s own offspring is
a love so deeply planted in the heart by nature herself,
that even the wild beasts, as St. Ambrose says,
never fail to love their young.<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> It is said that even
tigers, hearing the cry of their whelps when they are
taken by the hunters, will plunge into the sea to swim
after the vessels where they are confined. If, then,
says our most loving mother Mary, even tigers cannot
forget their young, how can I forget to love you, my
children? And, she adds, even if it should happen
that a mother could forget her child, it is not possible
that I can forget a soul which is my child.<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>

<p>Mary is our mother, not according to the flesh, but
by love: “I am the mother of fair love.”<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> Hence she
becomes our mother only on account of the love she
bears us; and she glories, says a certain author, in
being the mother of love; because, having taken us
for her children, she is all love towards us.<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> Who can
describe the love of Mary for us miserable creatures?
Arnold of Carnotensis says that, at the death of Jesus
Christ, she ardently desired to die with her Son
for our sake.<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> So that, as St. Ambrose adds, when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
her Son hung dying on the cross, Mary offered herself
to his murderers, that she might give her life for us.<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

<p>But let us consider the reasons of this love, for thus
we shall better understand how this good mother
loves us. The first reason of the great love that
Mary bears to men, is the great love she bears to
God. Love to God and man is contained in the same
precept, as St. John has written: “This commandment
we have from God, that he who loveth God,
love also his brother;”<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> so that one increases as the
other increases. Hence what have the saints not done
for love of the neighbor, because they have loved God
so much? They have gone so far as to expose and
lose liberty and even life for his salvation. Let us
read what St. Francis Xavier did in India, where,
for the sake of the souls of those barbarians, he climbed
mountains, and exposed himself to innumerable dangers
to find those wretched beings, in the caverns
where they dwelt like wild beasts, and to lead them to
God. St. Francis de Sales, to convert the heretics of
the province of Chablais, risked his life by crossing a
river every day for a year, on his hands and knees, upon
a frozen beam, that he might go to the other side to
preach to those stubborn men. St. Paulinus became<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
a slave, to obtain liberty for the son of a poor widow.
St. Fidelis, to bring the heretics of a certain place back
to God, willingly consented, in preaching to them, to
lose his life. The saints, then, because they have
loved God so much, have done much for love of the
neighbor. But who has loved God more than Mary?
She loved God more, in the first moment of her life,
than all the saints and angels have loved him in the
whole course of theirs; as we shall consider at length,
when we speak of the virtues of Mary. She herself
revealed to sister Mary of the Crucifixion,<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> that the
fire of love with which she burned for God was so
great, that it would in a moment inflame heaven and
earth; and that, in comparison to it, all the flames of
the burning love of the seraphim were as cool breezes.
Therefore, as there is none among the blessed spirits
who loves God more than Mary; so there is, and can
be none, except God, who loves us more than this
our most loving mother. If the love of all mothers
for their children, of all husbands for their wives, and
of all saints and angels for their devoted servants, were
united, it would not be so great as the love that Mary
bears to one soul alone. Father Nierembergh says that
the love which all mothers have borne to their children
is a shadow when compared with the love which Mary
bears to any one of us. Truly she alone loves us
more, he adds, than all the angels and saints united.</p>

<p>Moreover, our mother loves us much, because we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
have been commended to her as children by her beloved
Jesus, when, before expiring, he said to her:
“Woman, behold thy son;”<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> signifying by the person
of John, all men, as we have before remarked. These
were the last words of her Son to her. The last remembrances
left by beloved friends at the moment of
their death are greatly valued, and the memory of
them is never lost. Moreover, we are children extremely
dear to Mary, because we cost her so much
suffering. Those children are much dearer to a
mother whose lives she has preserved:—we are those
children, for whom, that we may have the life of
grace, Mary suffered the pain of sacrificing the dear
life of her Jesus; submitting, for our sake, to see him
die before her eyes in cruel torments. By this great
offering of Mary we were then born to the life of divine
grace. So, then, we are children very dear to
her, because we were redeemed at such a cost of suffering.
Accordingly, as we read of the love which
the eternal Father has manifested for men by giving
his own Son to death for us, “God so loved the world
as to give his only-begotten Son:”<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> as St. Bonaventure
remarks, it may be said of Mary also, that she
so loved us as to give her only-begotten Son.<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> And
when did she give him to us? She gave him to us,
says Father Nierembergh, when first she consented to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
his death; she gave him to us, when others deserted
him through hatred or through fear, and she alone
could have defended, before the judges, the life of her
Son. We can easily believe that the words of so wise
and tender a mother would have had a great power,
at least with Pilate, to induce him to abstain from
condemning to death a man whom he knew and declared
innocent. But no, Mary would not utter even
one word in favor of her Son, to prevent his death,
upon which our salvation depended; finally, she gave
him to us again and again at the foot of the cross, in
those three hours when she was witnessing his death;
because then, at every moment, she was offering up
for us his life, with the deepest grief, and the greatest
love for us, at the cost of great trouble and suffering,
and with such firmness, that if executioners had been
wanting, as St. Anselm and St. Antoninus tell us,
she herself would have crucified him in obedience to
the will of the Father, who had decreed he should
die for our salvation. And if Abraham showed a similar
fortitude in consenting to sacrifice his son with his
own hands, we must believe that Mary would certainly
have done the same, with more resolution, as she was holier,
and more obedient than Abraham. But to return
to our subject. How grateful should we be to Mary, for
an act of so much love! for the sacrifice she made of
the life of her Son, in the midst of so much anguish,
to obtain salvation for us all! The Lord, indeed, rewarded
Abraham for the sacrifice he was prepared to
make to him of his son Isaac; but what can we render<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
to Mary for the life of her Jesus, as she has given
us a Son more noble and beloved than the son of
Abraham? This love of Mary, says St. Bonaventure,
greatly obliges us to love her, seeing that she has
loved us more than any other created being loves us,
since she has given for us her only Son, whom she
loved more than herself.<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

<p>And from this follows another reason why we are
so much beloved by Mary: because she knows that
we have been purchased by the death of Jesus Christ.
If a mother should see a servant redeemed by a
beloved son of hers, by twenty years of imprisonment
and suffering, for this reason alone how much
would she esteem that servant! Mary well knows
that her Son came upon earth solely to save us miserable
sinners, as he himself declared: “I have come
to save what was lost.”<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> And to save us he has consented
to lay down his life for us: “Becoming obedient
unto death.”<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> If Mary, then, had little love for
us, she would slightly value the blood of her Son,
which was the price of our salvation. It was revealed
to St. Elizabeth, the nun, that Mary, from the time she
was in the temple, was always praying that God
would quickly send his Son to save the world. Now,
how much more certainly must we believe that she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
loves us, after she has seen us so greatly prized by her
Son, that he deigned to purchase us at such a cost!</p>

<p>And because all men have been redeemed by Jesus,
Mary loves and favors all. She was seen by St. John
clothed with the sun: “And there appeared a great
wonder in heaven, a woman clothed with the sun.”<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a>
She is said to be clothed with the sun, because, as
“There is no one that can hide himself from his heat,”<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a>
so there is no one living on the earth who is deprived
of the love of Mary. From the heat of the sun, as
it is explained by the venerable Raymond Jordan, who
through humility called himself the Idiot, that is, from
the love of Mary.<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> And who, says St. Anthony,
can comprehend the care which this loving mother
has of us all? Therefore, to all she offers and dispenses
her mercy.<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> For our mother has desired the
salvation of all, and has co-operated with her Son in
the salvation of all.</p>

<p>It is certain that she is concerned for the whole
human race, as St. Bernard affirms;<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> hence the practice
of some devout servants of Mary is very useful,
who, as Cornelius à Lapide relates, have the habit of
praying our Lord to grant them those graces which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
the blessed Virgin is seeking for them, using these
words: “Oh Lord, give me what the most holy Virgin
Mary is asking for me.”<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> And this is well, as à
Lapide adds, for our mother desires greater things
for us than we think of asking for ourselves.<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> The
devout Bernardine de Bustis says, that Mary is more
desirous to do us good, and bestow favors upon us,
than we are to receive them.<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> Therefore blessed
Albertus Magnus applies to Mary the words of wisdom:
“She preventeth them that covet her, so that
she first showeth herself unto them.”<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> So great is the
love, says Richard of St. Laurence, which this good
mother bears us, that when she perceives our necessities,
she comes to relieve them. She hastens before
she is invoked.<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p>

<p>If Mary, then, is so good to all, even to the ungrateful
and negligent, who have but little love for her, and
seldom have recourse to her, how much more loving
must she not be to those who love her and often invoke
her! “She is easily seen by them that love
her.”<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> Oh, how easy it is, exclaims the same blessed
Albertus, for those who love Mary to find her, and
find her full of love and pity! “I love them that love<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
me,”<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> she assures us, and declares that she cannot
but love those who love her. And although our most
loving lady loves all men as her children, yet, says St.
Bernard, she recognizes and loves especially those who
most tenderly love her. Those happy lovers of
Mary, as the Idiot asserts, are not only loved, but
served by her.<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>

<p>Leonard the Dominican, as we read in the chronicles
of his order, who was accustomed to recommend
himself two hundred times a day to this mother of
mercy, when he was on his death-bed, saw one beautiful
as a queen by his side, who said to him: “Leonard,
do you wish to die and come to my Son and me?”
“Who are you?” answered the religious. “I am the
mother of mercy,” replied the Virgin; “you have
many times invoked me, and now I come to take you:
let us go to paradise.” On that same day Leonard
died, and we hope that he followed her to the kingdom
of the blessed.</p>

<p>“Ah, most sweet Mary, blessed is he who loves
you!” the venerable brother John Berchmans, of the
Society of Jesus, used to say: “If I love Mary, I am
sure of perseverance, and I shall obtain from God
whatsoever I wish.” And this devout youth was
never satisfied with renewing his intention, and often repeated
to himself: “I will love Mary, I will love Mary.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span></p>

<p>Oh, how much this our good mother exceeds all
her children in affection, even if they love her to the
extent of their power! “Mary is always more loving
than her lovers,” says St. Ignatius, martyr.<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> Let
us love her as much as St. Stanislas Kostka, who
loved this his dear mother so tenderly, that when he
spoke of her, every one who heard him desired to love
her also; he invented new titles by which he honored
her name; he never commenced an action without
first turning to her image and asking her blessing;
when he recited her office, her rosary, and other
prayers, he repeated them with such affectionate earnestness,
that he seemed speaking face to face with
Mary; when he heard the Salve Regina sung, his soul
and even his countenance was all on fire; when asked
one day by a father of the society, as they were
going together to visit an altar of the blessed Virgin,
how much he loved her, “Father,” he answered,
“what can I say more than that she is my mother?”
And that father tells us how the holy youth spoke
these words with such tender emotion of voice, countenance,
and heart, that he appeared not a man, but
an angel discoursing of the love of Mary.</p>

<p>Let us love her as much as blessed Hermann, who
called her his beloved spouse, whilst he also was
honored by Mary with the same name. As much as
St. Philip Neri, who felt wholly consoled in merely
thinking of Mary, and on this account named her his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
delight. As much as St. Bonaventure, who not only
called her his lady and mother, but, to show the tender
affection he bore her, went so far as to call her
his heart and his soul: “Hail, lady, my mother; yea,
my heart, my soul.”<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> Let us love her as much as
her great lover St. Bernard, who loved his sweet
mother so much, that he called her “the ravisher of
hearts:”<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> whence the saint, in order to express to her
the ardent love he bore her, said to her, “Hast thou
not stolen my heart?”<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> Let us name her our beloved
mistress, as St. Bernardine of Sienna named her, who
went every day to visit her before her sacred image,
in order to declare his love in the tender colloquies he
held with his queen. When he was asked where he
went every day, he answered that he went to find his
beloved. Let them love her as much as St. Louis of
Gonzaga, who burned continually with so great love of
Mary, that as soon as he heard the sound of the sweet
name of his dear mother, his heart kindled, and a
flame, perceptible to all, lighted up his countenance.
Let us love her like St. Francis Solano, who, distracted
by a holy passion for Mary, sometimes went
with a musical instrument to sing of love before her
altar, saying that, like earthly lovers, he was serenading
his beloved queen.</p>

<p>Let us love her as so many of her servants have
loved her, who had no way left of manifesting their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
love to her. Father Jerome of Trexo, of the Society
of Jesus, delighted in calling himself the slave of
Mary, and as a mark of his servitude went often to
visit her in a church: and what did he do there?
He watered the church with the tears of that tender
love which he felt for Mary; then he wiped them with
his lips, kissing that pavement a thousand times, remembering
that it was the house of his beloved mistress.
Father Diego Martinez, of the same society, who, on
account of his devotion to our Lady, on the feasts of
Mary, was carried by angels to heaven, that he might
see with how much devotion they were celebrated
there, said, “Would that I had all the hearts of the
angels and the saints to love Mary as they love her.
Would that I had the lives of all men, to devote
them all to the love of Mary!” Let others love her
as Charles the son of St. Bridget loved her, who said
that he knew of nothing in the world which gave him
so much consolation as the thought of how much
Mary was beloved by God; and he added, that he
would accept every suffering rather than that Mary
should lose, if it were possible for her to lose it, the
least portion of her greatness; and if the greatness
of Mary were his, he would renounce it in her behalf,
because she was more worthy of it. Let us desire to
sacrifice our life in testimony of our love to Mary, as
Alphonso Rodriguez desired to do. Let us, like Francesco
Binanzio, a religious, and Radagunde, wife of
King Clotaire, engrave with sharp instruments of iron
upon our breast the sweet name of Mary. Let us,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
with red-hot iron, impress upon our flesh the beloved
name, that it may be more distinct and more enduring,
as did her devoted servants Battista Archinto and
Agostino d’Espinosa, both of the Company of Jesus.</p>

<p>If, then, the lovers of Mary imitate, as much as possible,
those lovers who endeavor to make known their
affection to the person beloved, they can never love
her so much as she loves them. I know, oh Lady,
said St. Peter Damian, how loving thou art, and that
thou lovest us with unconquerable love.<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> The venerable
Alphonso Rodriguez, of the Society of Jesus, was
once standing before an image of Mary; and there
burning with love for the most holy Virgin, broke
forth into these words: “My most amiable mother, I
know that thou lovest me, but thou dost not love me
so much as I love thee.” Then Mary, as if wounded
in her love, spoke to him from that image and said:
“What dost thou say—what dost thou say, oh Alphonso?
Oh, how much greater is the love I bear
thee than the love thou bearest me! Know that the
distance from heaven to earth is not so great as from
my love to thine.”</p>

<p>With how much reason, then, did St. Bonaventure
exclaim: Blessed are those whose lot it is to be faithful
servants and lovers of this most loving mother!<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a>
For this most grateful queen is never surpassed in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
love by her devoted servants.<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> Mary, in this respect,
imitating our loving Redeemer Jesus Christ, makes by
her favors a twofold return to him who loves her. I
will exclaim, then, with the enamored St. Anselm:
May my heart languish, may my soul melt with your
never-failing love.<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> May my heart always burn and
my soul be consumed with love for you, oh Jesus,
my beloved Saviour, oh my dear mother Mary.
Grant then, oh Jesus and Mary, since without your
grace I cannot love you, grant to my soul, not through
my merits, but through yours, that I may love you as
you deserve. Oh God! the lover of men, thou hast
died for thy enemies, and canst thou deny to him who
asks it, the grace of loving thee and thy mother?<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></p>

<h5>EXAMPLE.</h5>

<p>It is narrated by Father Auriemma,<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> that a poor
shepherdess loved Mary so much that all her delight
was to go to a little chapel of our Lady, on a mountain,
and there in solitude, while her sheep were feeding,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
to converse with her beloved mother and pay her
devotion to her. When she saw that the figure of Mary,
in relief, was unadorned, she began, by the poor labor
of her hands, to make a drapery for it. Having gathered
one day some flowers in the fields, she wove
them into a garland, and then ascending the altar of
that little chapel, placed it on the head of the figure,
saying: “Oh, my mother, I would that I could place
on thy head a crown of gold and gems; but as I am
poor, receive from me this poor crown of flowers, and
accept it as a token of the love I bear thee.” Thus
this devout maiden always endeavored to serve and
honor her beloved Lady. But let us see how our good
mother, on the other hand, rewarded the visits and the
affection of her child. She fell ill, and was near her
end. It happened that two religious passing that
way, weary with travelling, stopped to rest under a
tree; one fell asleep and the other watched, but both
had the same vision. They saw a company of beautiful
virgins, and among them there was one who, in
loveliness and majesty, surpassed the rest. One of
the brothers addressed her, and said: “Lady, who
art thou? and where art thou going?” “I am the
mother of God,” she replied, “and I am going to the
neighboring village, with these holy virgins, to visit a
dying shepherdess, who has many times visited me.”
She spoke thus and disappeared. These two good
servants of God proposed to each other to go and
visit her also. They went towards the place where
the dying maiden lived, entered a small cottage, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
there found her lying upon a little straw. They saluted
her, and she said to them: “Brothers, ask of God
that he may permit you to see the company that surrounds
me.” They were quickly on their knees, and
saw Mary, with a crown in her hand by the side of
the dying girl, consoling her. Then those holy virgins
began to sing, and with that sweet music the
blessed soul was released from the body. Mary
crowned her, and took her soul with her to paradise.</p>

<h5>PRAYER.</h5>

<p><i>Oh Lady, Ravisher of hearts!</i> I would exclaim
with St. Bonaventure; who, with the love and favor
thou dost bestow upon thy servants, dost ravish
their hearts; take my miserable heart also, which
desires so earnestly to love thee. Thou, oh my
mother, with thy beauty hast enamored a God, and
hast drawn him from heaven into thy bosom, and
shall I live without loving thee? No. I will say
to thee with thy loving child John Berchmans: “I
will never rest until I have attained a tender love
for my mother Mary.”<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> No, I will not rest until
I am certain of having obtained a love—a constant
and tender love for thee, my mother, who hast
loved me with so much tenderness even when I
was so ungrateful towards thee. And where should I
now be if thou, oh Mary, hadst not loved me, and obtained<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
so many favors for me? If then thou hast
loved me so much when I did not love thee, how
much more may I confide in thy goodness, now that I
love thee? I love thee, oh my mother, and would
wish for a heart capable of loving thee, for all those
unhappy beings who do not love thee. Would that
my tongue could praise thee with the power of a thousand
tongues, in order to make known thy greatness,
thy holiness, thy mercy, and thy love, with which
thou lovest those who love thee. If I had riches, I
would employ them all for thy honor; if I had subjects,
I would make them all thy lovers; for thee and
for thy glory I would give my life, if it were required.
I love thee, oh my mother, but at the same time I
fear that thou dost not love me, for I have heard that
love makes lovers like those they love.<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> If then I
find myself so unlike to thee, it is a proof that I do
not love thee. Thou so pure, I so unclean; thou so
humble, I so proud; thou so holy, I so sinful. But
this, oh Mary, is to be thy work; since thou lovest
me, make me like unto thyself. Thou hast the power
to change the heart; take then mine and change it.
Let the world see what thou canst do for those who
love thee. Make me holy—make me worthy of thy
Son. Thus I hope; thus may it be.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span></p>

<h4 id="CHAPTER_I_SECTION_IV">SECTION IV.<br>
MARY IS ALSO MOTHER OF PENITENT SINNERS.</h4>

<p>Mary assured St. Bridget that she was mother not
only of the just and innocent, but also of sinners, provided
they wish to amend.<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> When a sinner becomes
penitent, and throws himself at her feet, he finds this
good mother of mercy more ready to embrace and
aid him than any earthly mother could be. This St.
Gregory wrote to the Princess Matilda: “Desire to
cease from sin, and I confidently promise you you will
find Mary more prompt than an earthly mother in
thy behalf.”<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> But whoever aspires to be the son of
this great mother, must first leave off sinning, and
then let him hope to be accepted as her son. Richard,
commenting upon the words, “Then rose up her
children,”<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> remarks, that first comes the word rose up,
<i>surrexerunt</i>, and then children, <i>filii</i>; because he cannot
be a son of Mary who does not first rise from the
iniquity into which he has fallen.<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> For, says St. Peter
Chrysologus, he who does works contrary to those
of Mary, by such conduct denies that he wishes to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
her son.<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> Mary is humble, and will he be proud?
Mary is pure, and will he be impure? Mary is full
of love, and will he hate his neighbor? He proves
that he is not, and does not wish to be the son of this
holy mother, when he so much disgusts her with his
life. The sons of Mary, repeats Richard of St.
Laurence, are her imitators in chastity, humility,
meekness, mercy.<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> And how can he who so much
disgusts her with his life, dare to call himself the son
of Mary? A certain sinner once said to Mary,
“Show thyself a mother;”<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> but the Virgin answered
him, “Show thyself a son.”<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> Another, one day, invoked
this divine mother, calling her mother of mercy.
But Mary said to him, “When you sinners wish me
to aid you, you call me mother of mercy, and yet by
your sins make me the mother of misery and grief.”
“He is cursed of God that angereth his mother.”<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a>
His mother—that is, Mary, remarks Richard.<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> God
curses every one who afflicts this his good mother, by
his bad life or his wilfulness.</p>

<p>I have said wilfulness, for when a sinner, although
he may not have left his sins, makes an effort to quit
them, and seeks the aid of Mary, this mother will not
fail to assist him, and bring him to the grace of God.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
This St. Bridget once learned from Jesus Christ himself,
who, speaking with his mother, said: “Thou
dost aid those who are striving to rise to God, and
dost leave no soul without thy consolation.”<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> While
the sinner, then, is obstinate, Mary cannot love him;
but if he finds himself enchained by some passion
which makes him a slave of hell, and will commend
himself to the Virgin, and implore her with confidence
and perseverance to rescue him from his sin, this good
mother will not fail to extend her powerful hand, she
will loose his chains, and bring him to a state of safety.
It is a heresy, condemned by the sacred Council of
Trent, to say that all the prayers and works of a person
in a state of sin are sins. St. Bernard says that prayer
in the mouth of a sinner, although it is without supernatural
excellence, since it is not accompanied by charity,
yet is useful and efficient in obtaining a release from
sin; for, as St. Thomas teaches,<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> the prayer of the
sinner is indeed without merit, but it serves to obtain
the grace of pardon; for the power of obtaining it is
based not upon the worth of him who prays, but upon
the divine bounty, and upon the merits and promise
of Jesus Christ, who has said, “Every one that asketh
receiveth.”<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> The same may be said of the prayers
offered to the divine mother. If he who prays, says
St. Anselm, does not deserve to be heard, the merits<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
of Mary, to whom he commends himself, will cause
him to be heard.<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> Hence St. Bernard exhorts every
sinner to pray to Mary, and to feel great confidence
in praying to her; because if he does not deserve
what he demands, yet Mary obtains for him, by her
merits, the graces which she asks of God for him.<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a>
The office of a good mother, says the same saint, is
this: if a mother knew that her two sons were deadly
enemies, and that one was plotting against the life of
the other, what would she do but endeavor in every
way to pacify him? Thus, says the saint, Mary is
mother of Jesus, and mother of man; when she sees
any one by his sin an enemy of Jesus Christ, she cannot
endure it, and makes every effort to reconcile
them.<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> Our most indulgent lady only requires the
sinner to commend himself to her, and have the intention
to reform. When she sees a sinner coming to
implore mercy at her feet, she does not regard the sins
with which he is laden, but the intention with which
he comes. If he comes with a good intention, though
he have committed all the sins in the world, she embraces
him, and this most loving mother condescends
to heal all the wounds of his soul; for she is not only
called by us the mother of mercy, but she really is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
such, and shows herself such by the love and tenderness
with which she succors us. The blessed Virgin
herself expressed all this to St. Bridget, when she
said to her, “However great may be a man’s sins,
when he turns to me, I am immediately ready to receive
him; neither do I consider how much he has
sinned, but with what intention he comes; for I do
not disdain to anoint and heal his wounds, because I
am called, and truly am, the mother of mercy.”<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a></p>

<p>Mary is the mother of sinners who desire to be
converted, and as a mother she cannot but compassionate
them, and it even seems that she regards the
woes of her poor children as her own. When the
woman of Chanaan implored Jesus Christ to liberate
her daughter from the demon which tormented her,
she said: “Have mercy on me, oh Lord, thou son of
David; my daughter is grievously troubled by a
devil.”<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> But as the daughter, not the mother, was
tormented by the devil, it would seem that she should
have said, “Oh Lord, have mercy on my daughter,”
not “have mercy upon me;” but no, she said, “Have
mercy upon me,”<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> and with reason, for all the miseries
of children are felt as their own by their mothers.
Exactly thus Mary prays God, says Richard of St.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
Laurence, when she commends to him a sinner who
has recommended himself to her: “Have mercy upon
me.”<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> It is as if she said to him, My Lord, this poor
creature, who is in sin, is my child; have pity on him,
not so much on him as on me who am his mother.
Oh, would to God that all sinners would have recourse to
this sweet mother, for all would certainly be pardoned
by God. Oh Mary, exclaims St. Bonaventure, in
wonder; thou dost embrace, with maternal affection,
the sinner who is despised by the whole world!
neither dost thou leave him until he is reconciled to
his Judge!<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> The saint here intends to say that the
sinner who remains in sin is hated and rejected by
all men; even insensible creatures, fire, air, the earth,
would punish him, and inflict vengeance upon him
in order to repair the honor of their insulted Lord.
But if this wretch has recourse to Mary, does she
banish him from her presence? No: if he comes
asking for help, and intending to amend, she embraces
him with the affection of a mother, and does
not leave him until she has reconciled him to God by
her powerful intercession, and re-established him in
his grace.</p>

<p>We read in the 2d book of Kings,<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> that the wise
woman of Thecua said to David: “My Lord, I had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
two sons, and for my misfortune one has killed the
other; so that I have already lost a child; justice
would now take from me my other and only son;
have pity on me a poor mother, and do not let me be
deprived of both my children.” Then David had
compassion on this mother, and liberated the criminal,
and restored him to her.<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> It appears that Mary
offers the same petition when God is angry with a
sinner, who has recourse to her: Oh my God, she
says to him, I had two sons, Jesus and man; man
has killed my Jesus on the cross; thy justice would
now condemn man; my Lord, my Jesus is dead; have
mercy upon me, and if I have lost one, do not condemn
me to lose the other also. Ah, God assuredly
does not condemn those sinners who have recourse to
Mary, and for whom she prays; since God himself
has given these sinners to Mary for her children.
The devout Lanspergius puts these words into the
mouth of our Lord: I have commended sinners to
Mary as her children. Wherefore she is so watchful
in the performance of her office that she permits none
to be lost who are committed to her care, especially
those who invoke her, and uses all her power to lead
them back to me. And who can describe, says
Blosius, the goodness, the mercy, the fidelity, and the
charity with which this our mother strives to save us,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
when we invoke her aid?<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> Let us prostrate ourselves,
then, says St. Bernard, before this good mother,
let us cling to her sacred feet, and leave her not until
she gives us her blessing, and accepts us for her
children.<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> Who could distrust the goodness of this
mother? said St. Bonaventure. Though she should
slay me, I will hope in her; and, confident in my trust,
I would die near her image, and be saved.<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> And thus
should every sinner say who has recourse to this kind
mother: Oh my Lady and mother, I deserve for my
faults that thou shouldst banish me from thy presence,
and shouldst punish me for my sins; but even if
thou shouldst cast me off and slay me, I shall never
lose confidence in thee and in thy power to save me.
In thee I entirely confide, and if it be my fate to die
before some image of thine, recommending myself to
thy compassion, I should have a certain hope of my
salvation, and of going to praise thee in heaven, united
to all thy servants who called upon thee for aid in
death, and are saved. Let the following example be
read, and let the reader judge if any sinner can distrust
the mercy and love of this good mother, if he
has recourse to her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span></p>

<h5>EXAMPLE.</h5>

<p>It is narrated by Belluacensis that in Ridolio, a city
of England, in the year 1430, there lived a young
nobleman named Ernest, who gave all his patrimony
to the poor, and entered a monastery, where he led
so holy a life that he was greatly esteemed by his
superiors, particularly for his special devotion to the
most holy Virgin. It happened that a pestilence
prevailed in that city, and the citizens had recourse to
that monastery to ask the prayers of the monks. The
abbot ordered Ernest to go and pray before the altar
of Mary, and not to quit it until she had given him an
answer. The youth remained there three days, and
received from Mary, in answer, some prayers, which
were to be said. They were said, and the plague ceased.
It happened afterwards that this youth became less ardent
in his devotion to Mary; the devil assailed him
with many temptations, especially to impurity, and to
a desire to flee from the monastery; and having neglected
to recommend himself to Mary, he resolved to
take flight by casting himself from the wall of the
monastery; but passing before an image of the Virgin
which stood in the corridor, the mother of God spoke
to him, and said: “My son, why do you leave me?”
Ernest was overwhelmed with surprise, and, filled with
compunction, fell on the earth, saying: “My Lady,
behold, I have no power to resist, why do you not
aid me?” and the Madonna replied: “Why have you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
not invoked me? If you had sought my protection,
you would not have been reduced to this; from this
day commend yourself to me, and have confidence.”
Ernest returned to his cell; but the temptations were
renewed, yet he neglected to call upon Mary for assistance.
He finally fled from the monastery, and
leading a bad life, he went on from one sin to another,
till he became an assassin. He rented an inn, where
in the night he murdered unfortunate travellers, and
stripped them of all they had. One night, among
others, he killed the cousin of the governor of the
place, who, after examination and trial, condemned
him to the gallows. But during the examination, a
young traveller arrived at the inn, and the host, as
usual, laid his plans and entered his chamber to assassinate
him: but on approaching the bed, he finds the
young man gone, and a Christ on the cross, covered
with wounds, in his place. Our Lord, looking compassionately
at him, said: “Is it not enough that I have
died once for thee? Dost thou wish to slay me again?
Do it, then; lift thy hand and kill me!” Then the poor
Ernest, covered with confusion, began to weep, and
exclaimed: “Oh Lord, behold me ready to return to
thee, who hast shown me so much mercy.” He immediately
left the inn to go back to the monastery and
do penance; but the officers of justice overtook him
on the way, he was carried before the judge, and in
his presence confessed all the murders he had committed.
He was at once condemned to death, without
even being allowed time for confession. He commended<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
himself to Mary. He was hung upon the
gallows, but the Virgin prevented his death. She
herself released him, and said to him: “Return to the
monastery; do penance; and when you shall see in
my hand a paper containing the pardon of thy sins,
then prepare to die.” Ernest returned, and having
related all to the abbot, did great penance. After
many years, he saw in the hand of Mary the paper containing
his pardon; he then prepared for his last end,
and died a holy death.</p>

<h5>PRAYER.</h5>

<p>Oh Mary, sovereign queen, and worthy mother of
my God, most holy Mary! Finding myself so vile, so
laden with sin, I dare not approach thee and call
thee mother. But I cannot let my miseries deprive
me of the consolation and confidence I feel in calling
thee mother. I know that I deserve to be rejected
by thee, but I pray thee to consider what thy son
Jesus has done and suffered for me; and then cast
me from thee if thou canst. I am a poor sinner, who,
more than others, have despised the divine Majesty;
but the evil is already done. To thee I have recourse:
thou canst help me; oh, my mother, help me. Do
not say that thou canst not aid me, for I know that
thou art omnipotent, and dost obtain whatever thou
desirest from thy God. If then thou sayest that
thou canst not help me, at least tell me to whom I
must have recourse for succor in my deep distress.
With St. Anselm, I will say to thee, and to thy Son:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
Have pity on me, oh thou, my Redeemer, and pardon
me, thou my mother, and recommend me to pardon;
or teach me to whom I may have recourse, who is
more compassionate than you, and in whom I may
have more confidence. No, neither in heaven nor on
earth can I find one who has more compassion for the
miserable, or who can aid me more than you. Thou,
oh Jesus, art my father, and thou, oh Mary, art my
mother. You love those who are the most wretched,
and you seek to save them. I am worthy of hell, and
of all beings the most miserable; you need not to
seek me, neither do I ask you to seek me; I present
myself to you with a sure hope that I shall not be
abandoned by you. Behold me at your feet; my
Jesus, pardon me; my Mary, help me.</p>

<h4 id="CHAPTER_II_SECTION_I">SECTION I.<br>
MARY IS OUR LIFE, BECAUSE SHE OBTAINS FOR US THE PARDON OF
OUR SINS.</h4>

<p>In order to understand rightly the reason why the
holy Church calls Mary our life, we must consider
that as the soul gives life to the body, so divine grace
gives life to the soul; for a soul without grace, though
nominally alive, in truth is dead, as we find in the
Apocalypse: “Thou hast the name of being alive, and
thou art dead.”<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> As Mary, then, obtains for sinners,
by her intercession, the gift of grace, she restores them
to life. The holy Church applies to her the following
words of Proverbs: “They that in the morning early
watch for me, shall find me.”<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> They shall find me,
or, according to the Septuagint, “they shall find
grace.”<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> Hence, to have recourse to Mary is to find
the grace of God; for, as immediately follows: “He
who finds me shall find life, and shall receive from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
God eternal salvation.”<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> Listen, as St. Bonaventure
exclaims here upon these words, listen, all ye who desire
the kingdom of God; honor the Virgin Mary,
and ye shall have life and eternal salvation.<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></p>

<p>St. Bernardine of Sienna says, that God did not
destroy man after his fall, because of the peculiar love
that he bore his future child Mary. And the saint
adds, that he doubts not all the mercy and pardon
which sinners received under the Old Law, was granted
them by God solely for the sake of this blessed
Virgin.<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a></p>

<p>Therefore St. Bernard exhorts us, if we have been
so unfortunate as to lose divine grace, to strive to recover
it, but to strive through Mary; for if we have
lost it, she has found it:<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> and hence she is called by
this saint, “The finder of grace.”<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> This the angel
Gabriel expressed for our consolation, when he said
to the Virgin, “Fear not, Mary, for thou hast found
grace.”<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> But if Mary had never been without grace,
how could the angel say to her that she had found it?<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
A thing is said to be found when it has been lost.
The Virgin was always with God and with grace; she
was even full of grace, as the Archangel himself announced
when he saluted her, “Hail! full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.”<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> If, then, Mary did not find
grace for herself, for whom did she find it? Cardinal
Hugo answers, when commenting upon the above
passage, that she found it for sinners who had lost
it. Let sinners, then, says the devout writer who
have lost grace, flee to Mary; with her they will certainly
find it; and let them say: Oh Lady, what is lost
must be restored to him who has lost it; this grace
which thou hast found is not thine, thou hast never
lost it; it is ours, for we have lost it, and to us thou
shouldst restore it.<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> In connection with which,
Richard of St. Laurence remarks: If then we desire
to find the grace of God, let us go to Mary, who
has found it, and always finds it.<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> And since she
ever has been, and ever will be, dear to God, if we
have recourse to her, we certainly shall find it. She
says, in the holy Canticles, that God has placed her
in the world to be our defence,<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> and therefore she is
ordained to be the mediatrix of peace between the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
sinner and God. “I am become in his presence as
one finding peace.”<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> By which words St. Bernard
gives encouragement to the sinner, and says: Go
to this mother of mercy, and show her the wounds
which thy sins have inflicted upon thy soul. Then
she will certainly pray her Son that he may pardon
thee by the milk with which she has nourished him,
and the Son who loves her so much will certainly hear
her.<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> So, too, the holy Church teaches us to pray
the Lord to grant us the powerful intercession of
Mary, that we may arise from our sins, in the following
prayer: “Grant us, oh merciful God! strength
against all our weakness; that we who celebrate the
memory of the holy mother of God, may, by the help
of her intercession, arise again from our iniquities.”<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a></p>

<p>Justly, then, does St. Lawrence Justinian call her
the hope of evil-doers, “spes delinquentium,” since
she alone can obtain their pardon from God. St.
Bernard rightly names her the ladder of sinners,
“Peccatorum scala;” since she, this compassionate
queen, offers her hand to poor fallen mortals, leads
them from the precipice of sin, and helps them to
ascend to God. St. Augustine rightly calls her the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
only hope of us sinners, since by her means alone we
hope for the remission of all our sins.<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> And St.
John Chrysostom repeats the same thing, namely,
that sinners receive pardon only through the intercession
of Mary.<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> Whence the saint in the name of all
sinners thus salutes her: Hail! mother of God and
ours; Heaven where God dwells; Throne from which
the Lord dispenses all graces; always pray to Jesus
for us, that by thy prayers we may obtain pardon in
the day of account, and the glory of the blessed in
heaven.<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> Finally, Mary is rightly called aurora:
“Who is she that cometh forth as the morning rising?”<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a>
Because, as Pope Innocent says, aurora is the end of
night, and the beginning of day, well is the Virgin
Mary, who is the end of vices and the beginning of
virtues, designated as aurora.<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> And the same effect
which the birth of Mary produced in the world, devotion
to her produces in the soul; she puts an end to the
night of sin, and leads the soul into the way of virtue.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
Hence, St. Germanus says: Oh mother of God,
thy protection is immortal! thy intercession is life.<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a>
And in his sermon on the <i>Zone of the Virgin</i>,<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> the
saint says that the name of Mary, to him who pronounces
it with affection, is either the sign of life, or
that soon he will have life.</p>

<p>Mary sang: “For behold, from henceforth all
nations shall call me blessed.”<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> On this account, says
St. Bernard, all nations shall call thee blessed, because
all thy servants by thy means shall obtain the life of
grace and eternal glory.<a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> “In thee sinners find pardon,
and the just perseverance, and afterwards life
eternal.”<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> Do not despair, as the devout Bernardine
de Bustis says, oh sinner, although you have committed
all possible sin, but confidently have recourse to
this Lady, for you will find her hands full of mercies.
Then he adds: Mary is more desirous to bestow
favors upon you than you are to receive them.<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a></p>

<p>By St. Andrew of Crete, Mary is called “The security<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
of divine pardon.”<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> By this is meant, that
when sinners have recourse to Mary that they may be
reconciled to God, God assures them of pardon, and
gives them the assurance by also giving them the
pledge of it. And this pledge is Mary, whom he has
given us for our advocate, by whose intercession, in
virtue of the merits of Jesus Christ, God pardons all
sinners who place themselves under her protection.
It was revealed to St. Bridget by an angel, that the
holy prophets were full of joy when they learned that
God, by the humility and purity of Mary, would become
reconciled to sinners, and receive into his favor
those who had provoked his wrath.<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a></p>

<p>No sinner need ever fear that he shall be rejected
by Mary, if he has recourse to her mercy. No, for
she is mother of mercy; and as such, desires to save
the most miserable. Mary is that happy ark in which
he who takes refuge will never suffer the shipwreck
of eternal ruin; “arca in qua naufragium evadimus.”
Even the brutes were saved in the time of the deluge
in the ark of Noe; so, under the mantle of Mary,
even sinners are saved. St. Gertrude one day saw
Mary with her mantle extended, beneath which
many wild beasts, lions, bears, and tigers had sheltered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
themselves; and Mary not only did not cast
them from her, but received them with pity and caressed
them. And by this the saint understood, that
the vilest sinners, when they flee to Mary, are not cast
out, but welcomed and saved from eternal death.
Let us enter, then, into this ark, and seek refuge under
the mantle of Mary; for she certainly will not reject
us, and will surely save us.</p>

<h5>EXAMPLE.</h5>

<p>It is narrated by Father Bovius,<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> of a very sinful
person named Helen, that having gone to church, she
accidentally heard a sermon on the rosary. As she
went out she bought one, but carried it hidden, so that
it should not be seen. Afterwards, she began to recite
it; and although she recited it without devotion,
the most holy Virgin infused into her heart such consolation
and sweetness in it, that she could not cease
repeating it. And by this she was inspired with such
a horror of her evil life, that she could find no peace,
and was forced, as it were, to go to confession. She
confessed with so much contrition, that the confessor
was amazed. Having finished her confession, she
went immediately before an altar of the blessed Virgin,
to thank her advocate; she recited her rosary,
and the divine mother spoke to her from her image,
and said: “Helen, you have too long offended God
and me; henceforth change your life, and I will bestow<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
upon you many of my favors.” The poor sinner,
in confusion, answered: “Ah, most holy Virgin, it is
true that hitherto I have been very sinful, but thou,
who art all-powerful, assist me; I give myself to thee,
and will pass the remainder of my life in doing penance
for my sins.” Assisted by Mary, Helen bestowed
all her goods upon the poor, and commenced a rigorous
penance. She was tormented by dreadful temptations,
but she continued to recommend herself to the
mother of God; and always, with her aid, came off
victorious. She was favored also with many supernatural
graces, as visions, revelations, and prophecies.
At last, before her death, of which she had been
warned a few days previously by Mary, the Virgin
herself came with her Son to visit her; and in death,
the soul of this sinner was seen, in the form of a beautiful
dove, ascending to heaven.</p>

<h5>PRAYER.</h5>

<p>Behold, oh mother of my God, Mary, my only hope,
behold at thy feet a miserable sinner, who implores
thy mercy. Thou art proclaimed and called by the
whole Church, and by all the faithful, the refuge of
sinners; thou then art my refuge; it is thine to save
me. Thou knowest how much thy Son desires our
salvation.<a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> Thou, too, knowest what Jesus Christ
suffered to save me. I offer to thee, oh my mother,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
the sufferings of Jesus; the cold which he endured in
the stable, the steps of his long journey into Egypt,
his toils, his sweat, the blood that he shed, the torments
which caused his death before thy eyes upon
the cross; show thy love for this Son, whilst I, for the
love of him, beg thee to aid me. Extend thy hand to
a fallen creature, who asks pity of thee. If I were a
saint, I would not ask for mercy; but because I am a
sinner, I have recourse to thee, who art the mother
of mercies. I know that thy compassionate heart
finds consolation in succoring the wretched, when thou
canst aid them, and dost not find them obstinate in
their sins. Console, then, to-day thy own compassionate
heart, and console me; for thou hast a chance
to save me, a poor wretch condemned to hell; and
thou canst aid me, for I will not be obstinate. I place
myself in thy hands; tell me what I must do, and obtain
for me strength to do it, and I will do all I can to
return to a state of grace. I take refuge beneath thy
mantle. Jesus Christ wishes me to have recourse to
thee, that, for thy glory and his, since thou art his
mother, not only his blood, but also thy prayers, may
aid me to obtain salvation. He sends me to thee that
thou mayest assist me. Oh Mary, I hasten to thee,
and in thee I trust. Thou dost pray for so many
others, pray, and say also one word for me. Say to
God, that thou desirest my salvation, and God certainly
will save me. Tell him that I am thine; this
is all I ask from thee.</p>

<h4 id="CHAPTER_II_SECTION_II">SECTION II.<br>
MARY IS AGAIN OUR LIFE, BECAUSE SHE OBTAINS FOR US PERSEVERANCE.</h4>

<p>Final perseverance is a divine gift so great, that, as
the holy Council of Trent has declared, it is a wholly
gratuitous gift, and one that cannot be merited by us.
But, as St. Augustine teaches us, all those obtain perseverance
from God who ask it of him; and as Father
Suarez says, they infallibly obtain it if they are diligent
to the end of life in praying God for it; because, as
Cardinal Bellarmine writes: This perseverance is daily
to be sought, that it may be daily obtained.<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> Now, if
it is true, which I consider certain, according to the
present very general opinion, as I shall presently demonstrate
in chap. 5th—if it is true that all the graces
which are bestowed on us by God pass through the
hands of Mary, it must also be true that only through
Mary can we hope for and obtain this great gift of
perseverance. And we certainly shall obtain it, if,
with confidence, we always ask it of Mary. She herself
promises this grace to all those who serve her
faithfully in this life. “They that work by me shall
not sin; they that explain me shall have life everlasting:”<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a>
which words the holy Church puts into the
mouth of Mary on the Feast of her Conception.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span></p>

<p>In order that we may be preserved in the life of divine
grace, spiritual strength is necessary to resist all
the enemies of our salvation. Now, this strength can
only be obtained by means of Mary: Mine is this
strength, says Mary: “Mea est fortitudo.” God
has intrusted this gift to my hand, that I may bestow
it on my devoted servants. “By me kings reign:”
“Per me reges regnant.”<a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> By me my servants reign,
and rule their senses and their passions, and thus
make themselves worthy of reigning eternally in heaven.
Oh, what strength have the servants of this
great Lady to conquer all the temptations of hell!
Mary is that tower spoken of in the holy Canticles:
“Thy neck is as the tower of David, which is built
with bulwarks; a thousand bucklers hang upon it, all
the armor of valiant men.”<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> She is like a strong
tower of defence for her lovers, who take refuge with
her in the day of battle; in her all her devoted servants
find shields and weapons of every kind to defend
themselves against the powers of hell.</p>

<p>For this reason, the most holy Virgin is called a
plane-tree: “As a plane-tree by the water in the
streets was I exalted.”<a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> This passage is explained
by Cardinal Hugo, who tells us that the plane-tree has<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
leaves like shields.<a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> And by this is explained the defence
that Mary affords those who take refuge with
her. The blessed Amadeus gives another explanation,
and says that she is called a plane-tree because, as
the plane-tree, with its shade, protects the traveller
from the heat of the sun and from the rain, so,
under the mantle of Mary, men find shelter from
the heat of their passions and the fury of temptations.<a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a></p>

<p>Unfortunate are those souls who withdraw from this
shelter, neglect their devotion to Mary, and fail to recommend
themselves to her in trial. If the sun should
no more rise upon the world, says St. Bernard, what
would the world become but a chaos of darkness and
horror?<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> If a soul loses her devotion to Mary, she
will immediately be full of darkness, and that darkness
of which the Holy Ghost says: “Thou hast appointed
darkness, and it is night; in it shall all the beasts of
the woods go about.”<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> When the divine light does
not shine in a soul it is night, and it will become a den
of all sins and demons. Woe to those, as St. Anselm
says, who turn away from the light of this sun;<a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
that is, who neglect devotion to Mary. St. Francis
Borgia, with reason, feared for the perseverance of
those in whom he did not find a special devotion to
the blessed Virgin. When once he asked some novices
to what saint they had the most devotion, and found
that some of them were not especially devoted to
Mary, he warned the master to watch more carefully
these unfortunate persons; and it happened that they
all lost their vocation and quitted religion.</p>

<p>St. Germanus justly called the most holy Virgin
the breath of Christians; because, as the body cannot
live without breathing, so the soul cannot live without
having recourse and commending itself to Mary,
through whose means the life of divine grace is obtained
for us and preserved in us.<a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> As respiration is
not only the sign, but also the cause of life, so the
name of Mary, when it is spoken by the servants of
God, not only proves that they are living, but procures
and maintains this life, and obtains for them
every aid. The blessed Alanus, when once assailed
by a strong temptation, was on the point of being lost
because he omitted to recommend himself to Mary;
but the blessed Virgin appeared to him, and, to warn
him against such neglect in future, gave him a blow
on the ear, and said to him: “If thou hadst commended<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
thyself to me, thou wouldst not have been exposed
to this peril.”</p>

<p>On the other hand: “Blessed is the man,” says
Mary, “that heareth me, and that watcheth daily at
my gates, and waiteth at the posts of my doors.”<a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a>
Mary will certainly be ready to obtain light and
strength for those faithful servants, that they may
abandon their vices and walk in the paths of virtue.
Hence is she, as Innocent III. beautifully expresses
it: The moon by night, the dawn of the morning, and
the sun by day.<a id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> The moon, to him who is groping
in the night of sin, to give him light to see his wretched
state of condemnation; the dawn, the forerunner of
the sun, to him who is enlightened, that he may come
forth from sin and return to divine grace; and the
sun, to him who is in grace, that he may not again
fall into any precipice.</p>

<p>Theologians apply to Mary these words of Ecclesiasticus:
“Her bands are a healthful binding.”<a id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a>
Wherefore are they called bands, asks St. Lawrence
Justinian, unless because she binds her servants, that
they may not wander in forbidden fields?<a id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> St. Bonaventure
explains in a similar manner the words of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
office of Mary: “My abode is in the full assembly of
saints.”<a id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> He says that Mary is not only established
in the fulness of the saints, but that she also upholds
the saints, that they may not fall away; she sustains
their virtue that it may not waver, and prevents the
demons from doing them harm.<a id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a></p>

<p>It is said that “all her domestics are clothed with
double garments.”<a id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> Cornelius à Lapide thus describes
this double garment: It is a double garment, because
she clothes her servants with the virtues of her Son,
as well as with her own;<a id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> and, thus clothed, they will
preserve holy perseverance. For this reason, St. Philip
Neri always admonished his penitents by saying to
them: My children, if you desire perseverance, be devout
to Mary. The venerable brother John Berchmans,
of the Company of Jesus, also said: He who
loves Mary, shall have perseverance. The reflection
which Rupert the Abbot makes upon the prodigal son
is very beautiful. If the mother of this prodigal son
had been living, he would either never have left his
father’s house, or would have returned much sooner.<a id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
And by this he wished to say, that he who is a child
of Mary, either never departs from God, or if for his
misfortune he departs, by means of Mary he quickly
returns.</p>

<p>Oh, if all men loved this most kind and loving Lady,
and in temptations always and immediately had recourse
to her, who would fall? Who would be lost?
He falls and is lost who does not flee to Mary. St.
Lawrence Justinian applies to Mary these words of
Ecclesiasticus: “I have walked in the waves of the
sea;”<a id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> and makes her to say: I walk with my servants
in the midst of the tempests to which they are
exposed, to assist them, and prevent them from falling
into the precipice of sin.<a id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a></p>

<p>Father Bernardine de Bustis relates that a hawk
darted upon a bird which had been taught to say Ave
Maria; the bird said Ave Maria, and the hawk fell
dead. By this our Lord wished to show us, that if
an irrational bird was saved from destruction by invoking
Mary, how much more surely will he be prevented
from falling into the power of evil spirits, who
is mindful to invoke Mary in his temptations. Nothing
remains to be done, says St. Thomas of Villanova,
when the devils come to tempt us, but, like the chickens
when the kite appears, to run quickly under the
shelter of the wings of our mother. Let us, then, at
the approach of the temptations which assail us, without<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
stopping to parley with them, place ourselves at
once under the protection of Mary.<a id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> And then, the
saint goes on to say, our Lady and mother must defend
us; for, after God, we have no refuge but thee, who
art our only hope, and the only protectress in whom
we may confide.<a id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a></p>

<p>Let us, then, conclude with the words of St. Bernard:<a id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a>
Oh man, whoever thou art, thou knowest that
in this miserable life thou art rather tossing on the
tempestuous waves, among dangers and tempests,
than walking upon the earth; if thou wouldst not
sink, keep thy eye fixed on this star, namely, Mary.
Look at the star, invoke Mary. When in danger of
sinning, when tormented by temptations, when doubts
disturb thee, remember that Mary can aid thee, and instantly
call upon her. May her powerful name never
depart from the confidence of thy heart, nor from the
invocation of thy lips. If thou wilt follow Mary, thou<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
shalt never wander from the path of safety. Commend
thyself always to her, and thou shalt not despair.
If she upholds thee, thou shalt not fall. If
she protects thee, thou need not fear ruin. If she
guides thee, thou shalt be saved without difficulty.
In a word, if Mary undertakes to defend thee, thou
shalt certainly arrive at the kingdom of the blessed.
Thus do, and thou shalt live.</p>

<h5>EXAMPLE.</h5>

<p>In the celebrated history of St. Mary of Egypt,
which we find in the first volume of the Lives of the
Fathers, we read that, at twelve years of age, she fled
from her parents, and went to Alexandria, where she
led an infamous life, and became the scandal of the
city. After sixteen years spent in sin, she wandered
off to Jerusalem; where, on the festival of the Holy
Cross, she was led to enter the church, more from
curiosity than devotion. On the threshold she was
thrust back, as if by some invisible power; she attempted
a second time to enter, and again was repelled,
and a third and a fourth time the same thing
happened. The wretched creature withdrew then
into a corner of the portico, and there she was interiorly
enlightened, and saw that God had refused her
entrance into the church on account of her wicked
life. By chance she raised her eyes, and saw a picture
of Mary which was painted in the vestibule. She
turned to it, weeping, and said: “Oh mother of God,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
have pity on this poor sinner! I know that, on account
of my sins, I do not deserve that thou shouldst
regard me; but thou art the refuge of sinners: for the
love of Jesus, thy Son, help me. Obtain for me that
I may enter the church, for I desire to change my
life, and go and do penance wherever thou shalt direct.”
Then she heard an interior voice, as if the
blessed Virgin answered her: “Come, since thou hast
invoked me, and wishest to change thy life, enter the
church, for the door will no longer be closed against
thee.” The sinner entered, adored the cross, and wept.
She returned to the picture: “Oh Lady,” she said,
“I am ready; where shall I retire to do penance?”
“Go,” said the Virgin, “beyond the Jordan, and thou
wilt find the place of thy repose.” She made her confession,
received holy communion, passed the river, reached
the desert, and understood that there was her place
of penance. During the first seventeen years that she
lived in the desert, the evil spirits fiercely assailed her,
to make her fall again. What did she then do? She
recommended herself to Mary, and Mary obtained for
her strength to resist for seventeen years, after which
the conflict ceased. Finally, after fifty-seven years
spent in the desert, in the eighty-seventh of her age,
through Divine Providence, she was found by the abbot
St. Zosimus. To him she related the story of her
whole life, and begged him to return there the following
year, and bring her holy communion. The holy
abbot returned, and gave her communion. Then she
implored him again to do the same thing. He returned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
the second time, and found her dead, her body surrounded
with light, and at her head these words written
in the sand: “Bury in this place the body of me,
a miserable sinner, and pray God for me.” A lion
came and dug her grave, the abbot buried her, and,
returning to the monastery, he related the wonders of
divine mercy towards this happy penitent.</p>

<h5>PRAYER.</h5>

<p>Oh mother of mercy! holy Virgin! behold at thy
feet the traitor, who, returning ingratitude for the
favors received through thee from God, has betrayed
thee and God. But, oh my Lady! know that my
misery does not destroy, but increases my confidence
in thee, because I see that my misery increases thy
compassion for me. Show, oh Mary! that thou art
the same to me as thou art to all those who invoke
thee, full of grace and mercy. It is enough for me
that thou regardest me with compassion. If in thy
heart thou hast pity for me, thou wilt not cease to
protect me; and if thou dost protect me, what should
I fear? No, I fear nothing; I fear not my sins, for
thou canst remedy their evil consequences; nor the
demons, for thou art more powerful than hell; nor
thy Son who is justly angry with me, for at one word
of thine he will be appeased. I only fear that through
negligence I may fail to implore thy protection in my
temptations, and that this may cause my ruin. But
I promise thee to-day, I will always have recourse to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
thee. Help me to keep this resolution. Behold the
opportunity thou hast of satisfying thy desire to relieve
so miserable a creature as I am.</p>

<p>Oh mother of God, I have great confidence in thee.
From thee I expect the grace to do just penance for
my sins, and from thee I hope the strength never more
to fall back into them. If I am sick, thou canst heal
me, oh heavenly physician. If my sins have made
me weak, thy help can make me strong. Oh Mary,
I hope every thing from thee, for thou hast all power
with God.</p>

<h4 id="CHAPTER_II_SECTION_III">SECTION III.<br>
MARY RENDERS DEATH SWEET TO HER SERVANTS.</h4>

<p><i>Dulcedo</i>:—Sweetness.</p>

<p>“He that is a friend loveth at all times; and a
brother is proved in distress.”<a id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> <i>True</i> friends and relatives
are not known in times of prosperity, but in
the season of adversity and misery. Worldly friends
do not desert their friend when he is in prosperity;
but if any misfortune overtakes him, particularly in
the hour of death, immediately his friends abandon
him. Not so does Mary desert her devoted servants.
In their distresses, and especially at the trying hour
of death, when our sufferings are the greatest that
can be endured on earth, she our good Lady and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
mother cannot abandon her faithful servants; and as
she is our life in the time of our exile, so is she also
our sweetness in the hour of death, by obtaining for
us that it may be sweet and blessed. For since that
great day in which it was the lot and the grief of
Mary to be present at the death of Jesus, her Son,
who was the head of the elect, she obtained the grace
of aiding at death all the elect. Hence the holy
Church requires us to pray the blessed Virgin, that she
would especially aid us in the hour of our death: “Pray
for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death.”<a id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a></p>

<p>The sufferings of the dying are very great, on account
of their remorse for sins committed, their dread
of approaching judgment, and the uncertainty of eternal
salvation. At that moment especially, the devil
puts forth all his power to gain the soul that is passing
into eternity; knowing that the time is short in
which he may win her, and that if he loses her, he
has lost her forever. “The devil is come down unto
you, having great wrath, knowing that he hath but a
short time.”<a id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> And therefore the devil, who has always
tempted her in life, will not be satisfied to tempt
her alone in death, but calls companions to his aid:
“Their houses shall be filled with serpents.”<a id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> When
any one is at the point of death, his house is filled
with demons, who unite to accomplish his ruin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span></p>

<p>It is related of St. Andrew Avellino, that at the
time of his death, ten thousand devils came to tempt
him; and we read in his life, that at the time of his
agony he had so fierce a struggle with hell, that it
caused all his good religious who were present to
tremble. They saw the face of the saint swell from
agitation, so that it became black; they saw all his limbs
trembling, and greatly agitated, rivers of tears flowed
from his eyes, and his head shook violently; all these
were signs of the horrible assault he was suffering
from the powers of hell. All the religious wept in
compassion, redoubled their prayers, and trembled
with fear when they saw that a saint died thus. Yet
they were consoled by seeing that the saint often
turned his eyes, as if seeking help, towards a devout
image of Mary, for they remembered that he had
often said in life, that in the hour of his death Mary
must be his refuge. It finally pleased God to terminate
this struggle by a glorious victory, for the
agitation of his body ceased, his countenance gained
its natural shape and color, and fixing his eyes tranquilly
on that image, he devoutly bowed his head to
Mary, who, it is believed, then appeared to him, as if
to thank her, and quietly breathed forth in her arms
his blessed soul, with heavenly peace depicted on his
countenance. At the same time a Capuchin nun, in
her agony, turned to the religious who were with her
and said: “Say an Ave Maria, for a saint has just
died.”</p>

<p>Ah, how these rebels flee before the presence of their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
queen! If, in the hour of death, we have Mary on
our side, what fear can we have of all the powers of
hell? David, in dread of the agony of death, comforted
himself with confidence in the death of his
future Redeemer, and in the intercession of the Virgin
mother: “For though I should walk in the midst of
the shadow of death, I fear no evils, for thou art with
me; thy rod and thy staff they have comforted me.”<a id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a>
Cardinal Hugo understands the <i>staff</i> to signify the
tree of the Cross, and the <i>rod</i> the intercession of Mary,
who was the rod foretold by Isaias: “And there shall
come forth a rod out of the root of Jesse, and a flower
shall rise up out of his root.”<a id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> This divine mother,
says St. Peter Damian, is that powerful rod by which
the fury of the infernal enemies is conquered.<a id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> Hence
St. Antoninus encourages us, saying: If Mary is for
us, who is against us?<a id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> Father Manuel Padial, of the
Society of Jesus, being at the point of death, Mary
appeared to him, and said, to comfort him: “The
hour has at length come when the angels, rejoicing,
say to thee, Oh happy labors! oh mortifications well
recompensed!” At which words an army of devils
was seen taking flight in despair, crying: “Alas! we
have no power, for she who is without stain defends<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
him.”<a id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> In like manner, the devils assailed Father
Jasper Haywood, when he was dying, with great
temptations against faith; he immediately commended
himself to the most holy Virgin, and then was heard
to exclaim: “I thank thee, oh Mary, that thou hast
come to my aid.”<a id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a></p>

<p>St. Bonaventure says that Mary sends the archangel
Michael, with all the angels, to the defence of
her dying servants, to protect them from the assaults
of evil spirits, and to receive the souls of all those
who have especially and constantly recommended
themselves to her.<a id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a></p>

<p>When a man leaves this life, Isaias says that hell is
in uproar, and sends its most terrible demons to tempt
that soul before it leaves the body, and then afterwards
to accuse it when it is presented at the tribunal
of Jesus Christ to be judged: “Hell below was in an
uproar to meet thee; at thy coming it stirred up the
giants for thee.”<a id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> But Richard says, that the demons,
when that soul is defended by Mary, will not
even dare to accuse it; knowing that a soul protected
by this great mother is never, and will never, be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
condemned.<a id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> St. Jerome wrote to the virgin Eustochium,
that Mary not only assists her dear servants in their
death, but also comes to meet them in their passage
to the other life, to encourage them and accompany
them to the divine tribunal.<a id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> And this agrees with
what the blessed Virgin said to St. Bridget, speaking
of her servants when they are at the point of death:
“Then I, their most loving Lady and mother, hasten
to them in death, that they may have consolation and
comfort.”<a id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> St. Vincent of Ferrer adds: The blessed
Virgin receives the souls of the dying. The loving
queen receives their souls under her protection, and
she herself presents them to the judge her Son, and
thus certainly procures their salvation.<a id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> This happened
to Charles, son of St. Bridget, who, dying
in the perilous profession of a soldier, and far from
his mother, the saint feared for his salvation; but the
blessed Virgin revealed to her that Charles was saved
for the love he bore her, in recompense of which she
had assisted him in death, and had suggested to him
the christian acts necessary to be made at that moment.
The saint saw at the same time Jesus upon a
throne, and the devil bringing two accusations against<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
the most holy Virgin: the first, that Mary had prevented
him from tempting Charles at the moment of
death; the second, that Mary herself had presented
his soul to its judge, and thus had saved it without
even giving him an opportunity to expose the reasons
why he claimed it as his own. She then saw him
driven from the presence of the judge, and the soul
of Charles taken to heaven.</p>

<p>“Her bands are a healthful binding; in the latter
end thou shalt find rest in her.”<a id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> Blessed art thou,
oh brother, if in death thou shalt find thyself bound
by the sweet chains of love for the mother of God!
These chains are chains of salvation, which will secure
to thee eternal salvation, and give thee in death that
blessed peace which will be the commencement of thy
eternal peace and rest. Father Binetti, in his book
“On the Perfections of our Lord,” relates that having
been present at the death of a devoted servant of
Mary, he heard from him these words before he
breathed his last: “Oh, my Father, if you knew what
happiness I find in having served the most holy mother
of God! I could not describe to you the joy I feel at
this moment.”<a id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> Father Suarez, because he was all his
life very devoted to Mary, used to say, that he would
willingly exchange all his knowledge for the merit
of one Hail Mary, and died with so much joy, that
he exclaimed at his last moment, “I never imagined
it would be so sweet to die,—non putabam tam dulce<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
esse mori.”<a id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> You too, devout reader, will doubtless
feel the same peace and joy, if at death you can remember
having loved this good mother, who cannot
but be faithful to her children, when they are faithful
to her service, paying her their offerings of visits, rosaries,
and fastings, and especially thanking her,
praising her, and often commending themselves to her
powerful protection.</p>

<p>Neither will you be deprived of this consolation on
account of your sins, if from henceforth you will be
careful to live well, and to serve this very grateful and
gracious Lady. In the trials and temptations with
which the devil will assail you, that he may throw
you into despair, she will comfort you, and even come
herself to assist you in death. Martin, brother of St.
Peter Damian, as the saint himself relates, finding that
he had offended God, went one day before an altar
of Mary to dedicate himself to her service, putting his
girdle around his neck in token of his servitude, and
thus said: “My Lady, mirror of purity, I, a poor sinner,
have offended God and thee by violating chastity:
I have no other remedy than to offer myself as thy servant;
to thy service I dedicate myself to-day; receive
this rebel, do not despise me.” He then laid on the altar
a certain sum of money, promising to pay the same
every year as a tribute of his devotion to Mary. After
some time Martin died; but before his death he was
heard one morning to say: “Arise, arise, pay homage
to my Lady;” and afterwards: “What a favor is this,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
oh queen of heaven, that thou shouldst condescend
to visit this thy poor servant. Bless me, oh Lady,
and permit me not to be lost after thou hast honored
me with thy presence.” At this moment his brother
Peter entered. Martin related to him the visit of
Mary, and how she had blessed him, lamenting that
the persons present had not arisen at her entrance;
and shortly after quietly passed away to our Lord. Such
will be your death also, oh my reader, if you are faithful
to Mary, even if in your past life you have offended
God. She will give you a sweet and happy death.</p>

<p>And if then you are greatly alarmed and lose
courage in view of the sins you have committed, she
will come to comfort you as she came to Adolphus,
Count of Alsace, who, having quitted the world and
become a Franciscan, as the chronicles relate, was very
devoted to the mother of God. His last days arrived,
and at the remembrance of the life he had led in the
world, and the rigor of divine justice, he began to fear
death and doubt of his salvation. Then Mary, who
never sleeps when her faithful servants are in trouble,
accompanied by many saints, appeared to him, and
encouraged him with these tender words of consolation:
“My dear Adolphus, thou art mine, thou hast
given thyself to me, then why dost thou so greatly
fear death?”<a id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> The servant of Mary was consoled
by these words; every fear disappeared, and he died
in great peace and contentment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span></p>

<p>Let us, too, although we are sinners, take courage
and have the confidence that Mary will come to assist
us in death, and console us by her presence, if we
serve and love her during the remainder of our life on
this earth. Our queen, speaking one day to St. Matilda,
promised that she would be present at the death
of all those devoted children who had faithfully served
her in life.<a id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> Oh my God, what a consolation must it
be in that last hour of life, when our lot for eternity
is to be decided, to find close by our side the queen of
heaven, who sustains and comforts us by promising us
her protection! Besides the examples already cited
of the assistance afforded by Mary to her faithful servants,
there are innumerable others to be found in
various books. This favor was granted to St. Clare,
to St. Felix, a Capuchin, to the blessed Clara of Montefalco,
to St. Theresa, and St. Peter of Alcantara. But
for our common consolation, I will mention the few
following examples. Father Crasset relates<a id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> that St.
Mary of Oignies saw the blessed Virgin by the pillow
of a devout widow of Villembroe, who was tormented
by a burning fever. The most holy Mary was standing
by her side consoling her, and cooling her with a fan.
St. John of God, at death, expected a visit from Mary,
to whom he was greatly devoted; but finding she did
not come, he was afflicted, and perhaps complained<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
a little. But at length the holy mother appeared to
him, and as if reproaching him for his want of confidence,
said to him these tender words, which should
encourage all the servants of Mary: “John, it is not
in my heart, at this hour, to desert my children.”<a id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a>
As if she had said to him: My John, of what were
you thinking? that I had abandoned you? Do you
not know that I cannot abandon my devoted children
at the hour of death? I did not come before, because
it was not yet time; but now I come ready to take
you, let us go to paradise. And soon after the saint
expired, and flew to heaven to give thanks eternally
to his most loving queen.<a id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a></p>

<h5>EXAMPLE.</h5>

<p>I will now relate another example by way of conclusion
to the subject of which I have been just speaking,
and for the sake of showing how great is the tenderness
of this good mother towards her children when
they are dying.</p>

<p>The pastor of a certain place went to assist at the
death-bed of a rich man. He was dying in a splendid
house, and a multitude of relations, friends, and servants,
surrounded his bed. But among these, the
priest saw a number of devils in the shape of hounds,
who waited to seize upon his soul, and who actually
did so; for he died in sin. At the same time he was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
sent for by a poor woman, who was dying, and desired
the holy sacraments; not being able to leave the
dying rich man, whose soul was so much in need of his
assistance, he sent another priest to her, who accordingly
went, carrying with him the holy sacrament. He
found in the dwelling of that good woman no servants,
no retinue, no splendid furniture, for she was very poor,
and we may suppose had only a little straw to lie upon.
But what does he see? He sees in that apartment a
great light, and near the bed of the dying person was
Mary the mother of God, who was consoling her, and
with a cloth was wiping the sweat from her brow.
The priest seeing Mary, had not the courage to enter,
but she made a motion to him to approach. He entered,
Mary pointed to a seat, that he might sit down
and hear the confession of her servant. The poor
woman then made her confession, received the holy
sacrament with much devotion, and at last expired
happily in the arms of Mary.<a id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a></p>

<h5>PRAYER.</h5>

<p>Oh my sweetest mother, what will be the death of
me, a poor sinner? Even now, when thinking of that
great moment, in which I must die, and be presented
at the divine tribunal, and remembering how often, by
my wicked consent, I myself have written my own
sentence of condemnation, I tremble, am confounded,
and fear greatly for my eternal salvation. Oh Mary,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
my hopes are in the blood of Jesus, and in thy intercession.
Thou art the Queen of heaven! the Lady of
the universe! it is sufficient to say that thou art the
mother of God. Thou art great, but thy greatness
does not separate thee from us; it even inclines thee
to have more compassion on our miseries. When our
earthly friends are raised to any dignity, they seclude
themselves from those whom they have left in a low
estate, and will not condescend even to look at them.
But it is not so with thy loving and noble heart. Where
thou dost behold the greatest misery, there thou art
most intent on giving relief. When invoked, thou dost
immediately come to our aid, and even anticipate our
supplications; thou dost console us in our afflictions,
dissipate all tempests, put down our enemies; in a
word, thou dost never omit an opportunity of doing
us good. Ever blessed be that divine hand which
has united in thee so much majesty and so much tenderness,
so much greatness and so much love! I
always thank our Lord, and congratulate myself that
I can regard thy happiness and mine, thy fate and
mine as one. Oh consoler of the afflicted, console in
his affliction one who recommends himself to thee.
I am tortured with remorse for my many sins; I am
uncertain whether I have repented of them as I ought
to have done; I see how corrupt and imperfect are
all my works. The devil is awaiting my death in
order to accuse me. Divine justice violated must be
satisfied. Oh my mother, what will become of me?
If thou dost not aid me, I am lost. Answer me, wilt<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
thou aid me? Oh merciful Virgin, console me; obtain
for me strength to amend, and to be faithful to God
during what remains to me of life. And when I shall
find myself in the last agony of death, oh Mary! my
hope, do not abandon me; then more than ever assist
me, and save me from despair at the sight of my sins,
of which the devil will accuse me. Oh Lady, pardon
my boldness; come, then, thyself to console me by
thy presence. Grant me this favor which thou hast
bestowed on so many; I also desire it. If my boldness
is great, greater still is thy goodness, which seeks
the most miserable to console them. In this, thy
goodness, I trust. May it be to thy eternal glory
that thou hast saved from hell a miserable wretch,
and brought him to thy kingdom, where I hope to
console myself by being always at thy feet to thank,
bless, and love thee throughout eternity. Oh Mary,
I wait for thee, do not leave me then disconsolate.
Come, come. Amen, amen.</p>

<p class="center">SPES NOSTRA SALVE.</p>

<p class="center">Hail, our hope.</p>

</div>

<h4 id="CHAPTER_III_SECTION_I">SECTION I.<br>
MARY IS THE HOPE OF ALL.</h4>

<p>Modern heretics cannot endure that we should salute
Mary in this manner by calling her our hope.
Hail, our hope, “spes nostra salve.” They say that
God alone is our hope, and that he who places his
hope in a creature is accursed of God.<a id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> Mary, they
exclaim, is a creature, and, as a creature, how can she
be our hope? Thus say the heretics, but notwithstanding
this, the Church requires all the clergy, and all religious
daily to raise their voices, and in the name of
all the faithful, invoke and call Mary by the sweet
name of our hope, the hope of all: “Hail, our hope!”</p>

<p>In two ways, says the angelic St. Thomas, can we
place our hope in a person: as the principal cause, and
as the intermediate cause. Those who hope for some
favor from the king, hope for it from the king as
sovereign, and hope for it from his minister or favorite<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
as intercessor. If the favor is granted, it comes in
the first place from the king, but it comes through
the medium of his favorite; wherefore, he who asks a
favor justly calls that intercessor his hope. The king
of heaven, because he is infinite goodness, greatly desires
to enrich us with his graces; but, because confidence
is necessary on our part, in order to increase
our confidence, he has given us his own mother for
our mother and advocate, and has given her all power
to aid us; and hence he wishes us to place in her all
our hopes of salvation, and of every blessing. Those
who place all their hope on creatures, without dependence
upon God, as sinners do, who to obtain the
friendship and favor of man, are willing to displease
God, are certainly cursed by God, as Isaias says.
But those who hope in Mary, as mother of God,
powerful to obtain for them graces and life eternal,
are blessed, and please the heart of God, who
wishes to see that noble creature honored, who, more
than all men and angels, loved and honored him in
this world.</p>

<p>Hence, we justly call the Virgin our hope, hoping,
as Cardinal Bellarmine says, to obtain by her intercession
what we could not obtain by our prayers alone.<a id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a>
We pray to her, says St. Anselm, in order that the
dignity of the intercessor may supply our deficiencies.<a id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a>
Therefore, the saint adds, to supplicate the Virgin with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
such hope, is not to distrust the mercy of God, but to
fear our own unworthiness.<a id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a></p>

<p>With reason does the Church, then, apply to Mary
the words of Ecclesiasticus, with which she salutes
her: “Mother of holy hope;”<a id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> that mother who inspires
us not with the vain hope of the miserable and
transitory advantages of this life, but with the holy
hope of the immense and eternal good of the blessed
life to come. St. Ephrem thus salutes the divine
mother: “Hail, hope of the soul! hail, secure salvation
of Christians! hail, helper of sinners! hail, defence
of the faithful, and salvation of the world!”<a id="FNanchor_232" href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> St. Basil
teaches us that, next to God, we have no other hope
than Mary, and for this reason he calls her: After God
our only hope, “Post Deum sola spes nostra;” and St.
Ephrem, reflecting on the order of Providence in this
life, by which God has ordained (as St. Bernard says,
and we shall hereafter prove at length) that all those
who are saved must be saved by means of Mary,
says to her: Oh Lady, do not cease to receive and
shelter us under the mantle of thy protection, since,
after God, we have no hope but thee.<a id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> St. Thomas<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
of Villanova says the same thing, calling her our only
refuge, help, and protection.<a id="FNanchor_234" href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a></p>

<p>St. Bernard assigns the reason for this by saying:
Behold, oh man, the design of God, a design arranged
for our benefit, that he may be able to bestow upon
us more abundantly his compassion; for, wishing to
redeem the human race, he has placed the price of
our redemption in the hands of Mary, that she may
dispense it at her pleasure.<a id="FNanchor_235" href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a></p>

<p>God ordered Moses to make a propitiatory of the
purest gold, telling him that from it he would speak
to him: “Thou shalt make also a propitiatory of the
purest gold. Thence will I give orders, and will speak
to thee.”<a id="FNanchor_236" href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> A certain author explains this propitiatory
to be Mary, through whom the Lord speaks to men,
and dispenses to them pardon, graces, and favors.<a id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a>
And therefore St. Irenæus says that the divine Word,
before incarnating himself in the womb of Mary, sent
the archangel to obtain her consent, because he would
have the world indebted to Mary for the mystery of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
the incarnation.<a id="FNanchor_238" href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> Also the Idiot remarks, that every
blessing, every help, every grace that men have received
or will receive from God, to the end of the
world, has come to them, and will come to them,
through the intercession and by means of Mary.<a id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a>
Rightly, then, did the devout Blosius exclaim: Oh
Mary, who art so amiable, and so grateful to him who
loves thee, who will be so stupid and unhappy as not
to love thee? In doubt and perplexity thou dost enlighten
the minds of those who have recourse to thee
in their troubles. Thou art the comfort of those who
trust in thee, in time of danger. Thou dost help
those who invoke thee. Thou art, continues Blosius,
next to thy divine Son, the secure salvation of thy
servants. Hail, then, oh hope of the despairing!
Hail, helper of the destitute! Oh Mary, thou art
omnipotent, since thy Son would honor thee by immediately
doing all that thou desirest.<a id="FNanchor_240" href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a></p>

<p>St. Germanus, recognizing Mary to be the source of
every blessing and the deliverance from every evil, thus
invokes her: Oh my Lady, thou alone art my help,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
given me by God; thou art the guide of my pilgrimage,
the support of my weakness, my riches in poverty,
my deliverer from bondage, the hope of my salvation:
graciously listen, I pray thee, to my supplications,
take compassion on my sighs, thou my queen,
my refuge, my life, my help, my hope, my strength.<a id="FNanchor_241" href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a></p>

<p>Justly, then, does St. Antoninus apply to Mary
that passage of wisdom: “Now all good things came
to me together with her.”<a id="FNanchor_242" href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a> Since Mary is the mother
of God and the dispenser of all good, the world may
truly say, and especially those in the world who are
devoted to this queen, that, together with devotion to
Mary, they have obtained every good thing.<a id="FNanchor_243" href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> Wherefore
the Abbot of Celles said positively: He who has
found Mary finds every good thing.<a id="FNanchor_244" href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> He finds all
graces and all virtues; since she by her powerful intercession
obtains for him in abundance all that he
needs to make him rich in divine grace. She gives us
to know that she has with her all the riches of God,
that is, the divine mercies, that she may dispense them<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
for the benefit of those who love her. “With me are
riches and glory, that I may enrich them that love
me.”<a id="FNanchor_245" href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> Whence St. Bonaventure says: We should
all keep our eyes fixed on the hands of Mary, that
through her we may receive the blessings we desire.<a id="FNanchor_246" href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a></p>

<p>Oh! how many of the proud have found humility
through devotion to Mary; how many of the violent,
meekness; how many blind, the light; how many despairing,
confidence; how many lost, salvation! And
precisely this she herself predicted when she pronounced
in the house of Elizabeth that sublime canticle:
“Behold, from henceforth all generations shall
call me blessed.”<a id="FNanchor_247" href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> Which words St. Bernard repeats,
and says: All nations will call thee blessed, for to all
nations thou hast given life and glory; in thee sinners
find pardon, and the just find perseverance in divine
grace.<a id="FNanchor_248" href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> Whence the devout Lanspergius represents
the Lord thus speaking to the world: Venerate my
mother with especial veneration. Oh men, he says,
poor children of Adam, who live in the midst of so
many enemies and so much misery, strive to honor
with particular affection my mother and yours. I have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
given her to the world as an example of purity, a refuge
and asylum for the afflicted.<a id="FNanchor_249" href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> That is, I have
given Mary to the world for your example, that from
her you may learn to live as you ought; and for your
refuge, that you may have recourse to her in your
tribulations. This my child, says God, I have created
such that no one can fear her, or be unwilling to
have recourse to her, for I have created her with so
benign and compassionate a nature, that she will not
despise any who seek her protection, and she will deny
no favor to any who ask it. She spreads the mantle
of her compassion over all, and never permits any one
to go from her feet unconsoled. May the great goodness
of our God, then, be ever blessed, who has given
us this great mother and advocate, so loving and tender.</p>

<p>Oh! how tender are the sentiments of confidence
which filled the heart of the most loving St. Bonaventure
for his dear Redeemer Jesus, and for our loving
intercessor Mary! Let the Lord chastise me as much
as seemeth to him good, I know that he will not refuse
himself to those who love him and who seek him
with an upright heart. I will embrace him with my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
love, and I will not let him go till he has blessed me, and
he will not depart without me. If I can do nothing
else, at least I will hide myself in his wounds; there I
will remain, and out of himself he shall not be able to
find me.<a id="FNanchor_250" href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> Finally, he adds, if my Redeemer, for my sins,
drives me from his feet, I will cast myself at the feet
of his mother Mary, and, prostrate there, I will not depart
until she has obtained my pardon; for this mother
of mercy has never failed to take pity on misery and
console the wretched who seek her aid; and therefore,
if not from obligation, at least from compassion, she
will not fail to induce her Son to pardon me.<a id="FNanchor_251" href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a></p>

<p>Look upon us, then, we will conclude with the
words of Euthymius, look upon us, then, with thine eyes
of compassion, oh our most merciful mother, for we
are thy servants, and in thee we have placed all
our hope.<a id="FNanchor_252" href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a></p>

<h5>EXAMPLE.</h5>

<p>It is related in the Fourth Part of the Treasure of the
Rosary, miracle eighty-fifth, that a gentleman who was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
most devoted to the divine mother, had set apart in his
palace an oratory where, before a beautiful statue of
Mary, he was accustomed often to remain praying,
not only by day, but also by night, interrupting his
rest to go and honor his beloved Lady; but his wife,
for he was married, though she was a very devout
person, observing that her husband in the deepest
silence of the night left his bed, and going from his
apartment did not return for a long time, became
jealous, and was suspicious of evil; wherefore, one
day, to free herself from this thorn which tormented
her, she ventured to ask her husband if he ever loved
any other woman but herself. Smiling, he answered
her: “I assure you that I love the most amiable lady
in the world; to her I have given my whole heart,
and rather would I die than cease to love her; if you
knew her, you would say that I ought to love her
more than I do.” He meant the most holy Virgin,
whom he loved so tenderly. But his wife, conceiving
a greater suspicion than before, in order to ascertain
the truth better, interrogated him anew, and asked
him if he arose from his bed and left the room every
night to meet that lady. The gentleman, who did
not perceive the great trouble of his wife, answered
“Yes.” The wife was completely deceived, and,
blinded by passion, one night when her husband, according
to his custom, had left the chamber, seized a
knife in despair, cut her throat, and very soon died. Her
husband having finished his devotions, returned to his
apartment, but, on going to bed, found it wet. He<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
called his wife; she did not answer: he tried to arouse
her; she was immovable. At length he took a light,
found the bed full of blood, and his wife dead, with
her throat cut. Then he perceived that she had destroyed
herself through jealousy. What does he do?
He locks the door of his apartment, returns to the
chapel, prostrates himself before the most blessed
Virgin, and, shedding a torrent of tears, said to her:
“Oh my mother, behold my affliction: if thou dost
not console me, to whom shall I go? Remember I
am so unfortunate as to see my wife dead and lost
because I have come hither to pay thee honor: oh my
mother, who dost help us in all our troubles, help me
now.” How surely does every one obtain what he
wishes if he supplicates with confidence this mother of
mercy! No sooner did he offer this prayer than he
heard a servant-maid calling him: “My lord, come
to your apartment, for your lady calls you.” The
gentleman could hardly believe these words for joy.
Return, he said to the servant, and see if she really
calls me. She returned, entreating him to go quickly,
for her mistress was waiting for him. He went,
opened the door, and found his wife living; she threw
herself at his feet in tears and begged him to pardon
her, saying: “Oh, my husband, the mother of God,
through thy prayers, has delivered me from hell.”
Weeping for joy, they went to their oratory to thank
the blessed Virgin. The next day the husband made
a feast for all their relations, to whom the wife herself
related the facts, at the same time showing the marks<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
of the wound, and all were more deeply inflamed with
the love of the divine mother.</p>

<h5>PRAYER.</h5>

<p>Oh mother of holy love, oh our life, our refuge, and
our hope, thou knowest that thy Son Jesus Christ,
not content with making himself our perpetual intercessor
with the eternal Father, would have thee also
engaged in obtaining for us, by thy prayers, the divine
mercy. He has ordained that thy prayers should aid
in our salvation, and has given such power to them
that they obtain whatever they ask; I, a miserable
sinner, turn to thee then, oh hope of the wretched.
I hope, oh Lady, through the merits of Jesus Christ
and thy intercession, to secure my salvation. In these
I trust; and so entirely do I trust in thee, that if my
eternal salvation were in my own hands, I would wish
to place it in thine; for in thy mercy and protection I
would trust far more than in my own works. My
mother and my hope, do not abandon me, as I deserve.
Behold my misery, pity me, help me, save me. I
confess that I have often, by my sins, shut out the
light and aid which thou hast obtained for me from
the Lord.</p>

<p>But thy compassion for the wretched and thy
power with God are far greater than the number and
malignity of my sins. It is known in heaven and on
earth that he who is protected by thee will certainly
not perish. Let all forget me, but do not thou forget<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
me, oh mother of the omnipotent God. Say unto
God that I am thy servant, tell him that I am defended
by thee, and I shall be saved. Oh Mary, I
trust in thee; in this hope I live, and in this hope I
wish to die, repeating always: “Jesus is my only
hope, and after Jesus, Mary.”<a id="FNanchor_253" href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a></p>

<h4 id="CHAPTER_III_SECTION_II">SECTION II.<br>
HAST THE HOPE OF SINNERS.</h4>

<p>After God had created the earth he created two
lights, the greater and the less: the sun to give light
by day, and the moon to give light by night.<a id="FNanchor_254" href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> The
sun, says Cardinal Hugo, was the type of Jesus Christ,
in whose light the just rejoice, who live in the daylight
of divine grace; but the moon was the type of
Mary, by whom sinners are enlightened, who are living
in the night of sin.<a id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> Mary, then, being the moon, so
propitious to miserable sinners, if any unhappy person,
says Innocent III. finds that he has fallen into
this night of sin, what must he do? Since he has
lost the light of the sun, by losing divine grace, let
him turn to the moon, let him pray to Mary, and she
will give him light to know the misery of his condition,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
and strength to come forth from it.<a id="FNanchor_256" href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> St. Methodius
says that by the prayers of Mary innumerable sinners
are continually converted.<a id="FNanchor_257" href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a></p>

<p>One of the titles by which the holy Church teaches
us to invoke the divine mother, and which most encourages
poor sinners, is the title of “Refuge of Sinners,”
with which we invoke her in the Litanies.
There were anciently, in Judea, cities of refuge; and
criminals, who sought protection in them, were free
from the penalty of their offences. Now, there are not
so many cities of refuge, but instead of these there is
one only, Mary; of whom it was spoken: Glorious
things are said of thee, oh city of God—Gloriosa dicta
sunt de te civitas Dei.<a id="FNanchor_258" href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> But with this difference, that
not all criminals could find refuge in those ancient
cities, nor for all sorts of crime; but under the mantle
of Mary all offenders may find protection, whatever
crimes they have committed. It is sufficient for any
one to have recourse to her for protection. “I am the
city of refuge for all those who flee to me,”<a id="FNanchor_259" href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> as St.
John of Damascus says, speaking in her name.</p>

<p>It is enough that we have recourse to her. He
who has been so happy as to enter this city need not
speak in order to secure his safety. “Assemble yourselves,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
and let us enter into the fenced city, and let us
be silent there.”<a id="FNanchor_260" href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> This fenced city, as the blessed
Albertus Magnus explains it, is the holy Virgin, whose
defence is grace and glory. “Let us be silent there,”
according to the gloss: “since we may not dare to
supplicate the Lord for pardon, it is enough that we
enter into the city and are silent, for then Mary will
speak and will pray for us.”<a id="FNanchor_261" href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> Whence a devout
writer exhorts all sinners to seek shelter under the
mantle of Mary, saying: Fly, oh Adam, oh Eve,
and ye their children, who have offended God; fly
and take refuge in the bosom of this good mother.
Do you not know that she is the only city of refuge,
and the only hope of sinners?<a id="FNanchor_262" href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> As St. Augustine
has called her, The only hope of sinners: “Unica
spes peccatorum.”<a id="FNanchor_263" href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a></p>

<p>Hence St. Ephrem says: Thou art the only advocate
of sinners, and of those who are deprived of
every help; and he thus salutes her: Hail! refuge
and retreat of sinners, to whom alone they can flee
with confidence.<a id="FNanchor_264" href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> And this is what David intended<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
to express, says a certain author, when he said: “He
hath protected me in the secret place of his tabernacle.”<a id="FNanchor_265" href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a>
And what is this tabernacle, if not Mary?
As St. Germanus calls her, a tabernacle made by God,
in which none but God has entered, in order to complete
the great mysteries of human redemption.<a id="FNanchor_266" href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> On
this subject the great Father St. Basil says: The Lord
has given us Mary as a public hospital, where all the
infirm who are poor, and destitute of every other help,
may assemble: “Aperuit nobis Deus publicum valetudinarium.”
Now, in hospitals established expressly
for the reception of the poor, I would ask, who have
the first claim to be received, if not the poorest and
most infirm?</p>

<p>Wherefore, let him who finds himself most miserable,
because most destitute of merit, and most afflicted by
the maladies of the soul, namely, sins, say to Mary:
Oh Lady, thou art the refuge of the infirm; do not
reject me, for, because I am the poorest and most
infirm of all, I have the greater claim upon thee to
receive me. Let us say with St. Thomas of Villanova:
Oh Mary, we poor sinners know no refuge but
thee. Thou art our only hope; to thee we intrust
our salvation. Thou art the only advocate with Jesus
Christ; to thee we all have recourse.<a id="FNanchor_267" href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span></p>

<p>In the Revelations of St. Bridget, Mary is called
the star going before the sun: “Sidus vadens ante
solem.”<a id="FNanchor_268" href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> By which we are to understand, that when
devotion to the divine mother first dawns in a sinful
soul, it is a certain sign that God will soon come to
enrich her with his grace. The glorious St. Bonaventure,
in order to revive in the hearts of sinners confidence
in the protection of Mary, represents to us the
sea in a tempest, in which sinners who have fallen
from the bark of divine grace, tossed about by remorse
of conscience, and by the fear of divine justice, without
light and without a guide, have almost lost the
breath of hope, and are nearly sinking in despair; at
this critical moment the saint, pointing to Mary, who
is commonly called “The star of the sea,” raises his
voice and exclaims: Oh poor, lost sinners, do not
despair, lift your eyes to that beautiful star, take courage
and trust, for she will guide you out of the tempest,
and bring you to the port of safety.<a id="FNanchor_269" href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a></p>

<p>St. Bernard has said the same thing: If you would
not be overwhelmed in the tempest, turn to this star,
and call Mary to thy aid.<a id="FNanchor_270" href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> The devout Blosius also
says, that she is the only refuge for those who have
offended God: the asylum of all those who are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
tempted and afflicted.<a id="FNanchor_271" href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> This mother of mercy is all
kindness and all sweetness, not only with the just,
but also with sinners and those who are in despair;
so that when she beholds them turning towards her,
and sees that they are with sincerity seeking her help,
she at once welcomes them, aids them, and obtains
their pardon from her Son.<a id="FNanchor_272" href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> She neglects none, however
unworthy they may be, and refuses to none her
protection: she consoles all; and no sooner do they call
upon her, than she hastens to their help.<a id="FNanchor_273" href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> With her
gentleness she often wins their devotion, and raises
those sinners who are most averse to God, and who
are the most deeply plunged in the lethargy of their
vices, that she may dispose them to receive divine
grace, and at last render themselves worthy of eternal
glory.<a id="FNanchor_274" href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> God has created this his beloved daughter
with a disposition so kind and compassionate, that no
one can hesitate to have recourse to her intercession.<a id="FNanchor_275" href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a>
The devout writer concludes with saying: It is not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
possible that any one can be lost, who with exactness
and humility practises devotion to this divine
mother.<a id="FNanchor_276" href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a></p>

<p>She is called a plane-tree: As a plane-tree was I
exalted: “Quasi platanus exaltata sum.”<a id="FNanchor_277" href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> Sinners
may understand by this, that as the plane-tree gives
a shelter to travellers, where they may take refuge
from the heat of the sun, thus Mary, when she sees
the anger of divine justice kindled against them, invites
them to resort to the shelter of her protection.
St. Bonaventure remarks that Isaias, in his day, lamented,
and said: “Behold, thou art angry and we
have sinned ... there is none that riseth up and
taketh hold of thee;”<a id="FNanchor_278" href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a> because Mary was not yet
born into the world.<a id="FNanchor_279" href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> But now, if God is offended
with any sinner, and Mary undertakes to protect him,
she restrains the Son from punishing him, and saves
him.<a id="FNanchor_280" href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a> Also, continues St. Bonaventure, no one can be
found more fit than Mary to place her hand upon the
sword of divine justice, that it may not descend upon
the head of the sinner.<a id="FNanchor_281" href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> Richard of St. Laurence
expresses the same thought, when he says: God lamented,
before the birth of Mary, that there was no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
one to restrain him from punishing the sinner; but
Mary being born, she appeases him.<a id="FNanchor_282" href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a></p>

<p>St. Basil encourages sinners with the same thought,
and says: Oh sinner, be not timid, but in all thy
necessities flee to Mary, invoke her aid, and thou wilt
always find her ready to assist thee, for it is the divine
will that she should aid all men in all their necessities.<a id="FNanchor_283" href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a>
This mother of mercy has such a desire to save
the most abandoned sinners, that she even goes to seek
them; and if they have recourse to her, she will surely
find a method of rendering them dear to God.</p>

<p>Isaac being desirous to eat the flesh of some venison,
promised to give his benediction in exchange for
it to Esau; but Rebecca wishing that her other son
Jacob should receive this benediction, ordered him to
bring her two kids, for she would prepare the food
that Isaac loved. “Go thy way to the flock, bring
me two kids.”<a id="FNanchor_284" href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> St. Antoninus says that Rebecca was
the type of Mary, who says to the angels, Bring me
sinners (who are typified by the kids), that I may prepare
them in such a manner (by obtaining for them
sorrow and good resolutions) as to render them dear
and acceptable to my Lord.<a id="FNanchor_285" href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> The Abbot Francone, pursuing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
the same thought, says, that Mary so well understands
how to prepare these kids, that they not only
equal, but sometimes even surpass the flavor of venison.<a id="FNanchor_286" href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a></p>

<p>The blessed Virgin herself revealed to St. Bridget,
that no sinner in the world is so great an enemy to
God, that if he has recourse to her and invokes her aid,
does not return to God and is not restored to his favor.<a id="FNanchor_287" href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a>
And the same St. Bridget heard one day Jesus
Christ saying to his mother, that she could obtain the
divine favor even for Lucifer, if he would humble himself
so far as to ask her help.<a id="FNanchor_288" href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> That proud spirit
will never stoop to implore the protection of Mary, but
if such a thing could happen, Mary would take pity
upon him, and the power of her prayers would obtain
from God his pardon and salvation. But what cannot
happen to the devil may well happen to sinners who
seek the help of this mother of mercy.</p>

<p>Noe’s ark also prefigured Mary; because as in
that all the animal creation found refuge, so under the
mantle of Mary all sinners find protection, who have
made themselves like the brutes by their vices and
sensuality. With this difference, however, says a certain
author: The brutes entered into the ark and remained<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
brutes still; the wolf remained a wolf, the
tiger a tiger.<a id="FNanchor_289" href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> But under the mantle of Mary the
wolf becomes a lamb, the tiger a dove. St. Gertrude
once saw Mary with her mantle outspread, and under it
wild beasts of various kinds, leopards, lions, and bears;
and the Virgin not only did not drive them from her,
but with her gentle hand kindly received them and
caressed them. The saint understood that these wild
beasts were miserable sinners, who when they take
refuge with Mary are received by her with sweetness
and love.<a id="FNanchor_290" href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a></p>

<p>Justly, then, did St. Bernard say to the Virgin:
Oh Lady, thou dost abhor no sinner, however abandoned
and vile he may be, when he has recourse to thee;
if he asks thy help thou wilt condescend to extend thy
kind hand to draw him from the depths of despair.<a id="FNanchor_291" href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a>
Oh ever blessed and thanked be our God, oh most
amiable Mary, who made thee so merciful and kind towards
the most miserable sinners. Oh, wretched are
those who do not love thee, and who, having it in their
power to seek help of thee, do not trust in thee! He
who does not implore the aid of Mary is lost; but
who has ever been lost that had recourse to her?</p>

<p>It is related in Scripture that Booz permitted the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
woman named Ruth to glean the ears that the reapers
dropped and left behind them: “Colligebat spicas post
terga metentium.”<a id="FNanchor_292" href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a> St. Bonaventure adds, that as
Ruth found favor in the eyes of Booz, so Mary has
found favor in the eyes of the Lord, and is permitted
to glean after the reapers.<a id="FNanchor_293" href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> The reapers are the apostolic
laborers, missionaries, preachers, and confessors,
who toil through the day to gather and win souls to
God. But there are some rebellious and obdurate
souls who are left behind even by these reapers, and
it is granted to Mary alone by her powerful intercession
to save these abandoned ears. But unhappy are
those who do not yield themselves to this sweet Lady!
for they will be entirely lost and accursed! Blessed,
on the other hand, are those who have recourse to
this good mother! There is no sinner in the world,
says the devout Blosius, so lost and sunk in sin, that
Mary would abhor him and reject him. Ah, if such
would seek her aid, this good mother could and would
reconcile them to her Son, and obtain for them pardon.<a id="FNanchor_294" href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a></p>

<p>With reason, then, oh my sweetest queen, does St.
John of Damascus salute thee and call thee: “The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
hope of the despairing.”<a id="FNanchor_295" href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> Justly does St. Laurence
Justinian name thee: “The hope of evil-doers.”<a id="FNanchor_296" href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a> St.
Augustine: “The only refuge of sinners.”<a id="FNanchor_297" href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> St.
Ephrem: “The secure haven for the shipwrecked.”<a id="FNanchor_298" href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a>
The same saint calls thee even by another appellation:
“The protectress of the condemned.”<a id="FNanchor_299" href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a> Finally, St.
Bernard, with reason, exhorts the desperate not to
despair; whence, full of joy and tenderness towards
this his most dear mother, he asks her lovingly: Oh
Lady, who would not trust in thee, if thou dost thus
relieve even the despairing? I do not doubt in the
least, he adds, that if we always applied to thee we
should obtain what we wish. In thee, then, let the
despairing hope.<a id="FNanchor_300" href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> St. Antoninus relates that a sinner
finding himself in disgrace before God, imagined himself
standing before the tribunal of Jesus Christ: the
devil was accusing him and Mary defending him. The
enemy presented against this poor criminal the catalogue
of his offences, which, placed in the balance of divine
justice, far outweighed his good works; but what
then did his great advocate do? She extended her
kind hand and placed it in the other scale; it descended
in favor of her suppliant, and thus it was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
given him to understand, that she would obtain his
pardon if he would change his life; and, indeed, after
that vision he was converted and changed his life.</p>

<h5>EXAMPLE.</h5>

<p>The blessed John Erolto, who, through humility,
called himself <i>the disciple</i>, relates<a id="FNanchor_301" href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a> that there was once
a married man who lived in disgrace in the sight of
God. His wife, a virtuous woman, not being able to
induce him to abandon his vicious courses, entreated
him that at least, while he was in so miserable a condition,
he would offer this devotion to the mother of
God, namely, to say a “Hail Mary” every time he passed
before her altar. He accordingly began to practice
this devotion. One night, when he was about to commit
a sin, he saw a light, and, on closer observation,
perceived that it was a lamp burning before a holy
image of the blessed Virgin, who held the infant Jesus
in her arms. He said a “Hail Mary,” as usual; but
what did he see? He saw the infant covered with
wounds, and fresh blood flowing from them. Both
terrified and moved in his feelings, he remembered
that he himself too had wounded his Redeemer by
his sins, and began to weep, but he observed that the
child turned away from him. In deep confusion, he
had recourse to the most holy Virgin, saying: “Mother
of mercy, thy Son rejects me; I can find no advocate
more kind and more powerful than thou, who art<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
his mother; my queen, aid me, and pray to him in my
behalf.” The divine mother answered him from that
image: “You sinners call me mother of mercy, but
yet you do not cease to make me mother of misery,
renewing the passion of my Son, and my dolors.”
But because Mary never sends away disconsolate those
who cast themselves at her feet, she began to entreat
her Son that he would pardon that miserable sinner.
Jesus continued to show himself unwilling to grant
such a pardon, but the holy Virgin, placing the infant
in the niche, prostrated herself before him, saying:
“My Son, I will not leave thy feet until thou
hast pardoned this sinner.” “My mother,” answered
Jesus, “I can deny thee nothing; dost thou wish for
his pardon? for love of thee I will pardon him. Let
him come and kiss my wounds.” The sinner approached,
weeping bitterly, and as he kissed the wounds of
the infant, they were healed. Then Jesus embraced
him as a sign of pardon. He changed his conduct,
led a holy life, and was ever full of love to the blessed
Virgin, who had obtained for him so great a favor.</p>

<h5>PRAYER.</h5>

<p>I venerate, oh most pure Virgin Mary, thy most sacred
heart, which was the delight and repose of
God; a heart filled with humility, purity, and divine
love. I, an unhappy sinner, come to thee with a heart
filled with uncleanness and wounds. Oh mother of
mercy, do not on this account despise me, but let it
excite thee to a greater compassion, and come to my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
help. Do not look for virtue or merits in me before
thou grantest me thy aid; I am lost, and only merit
hell. Look at nothing, I pray thee, but the confidence
I have in thee, and the desire I cherish of
amending my life. Look at what Jesus has done and
suffered for me, and then abandon me if thou canst.
I offer to thee all the afflictions of his life, the cold
that he suffered in the stable, his journey to Egypt,
the blood that he shed, his poverty, toil, sweat, and
sadness, the death he endured in thy presence, for
love of me; and, for the love of Jesus, promise to
save me. Ah, my mother, I will not and I cannot
fear that thou wilt cast me from thee, when I flee to
thee and implore thy help. To fear this, would be
unjust to thy mercy, which seeks the miserable to relieve
them. Oh Lady, do not refuse thy compassion
to him to whom Jesus has not refused his blood; but
the merits of this blood will not be applied to me, if
thou dost not recommend me to God. From thee I
hope salvation. I do not ask of thee riches, honors, or
the other goods of earth; I only ask of thee the grace of
God, love for thy Son, the fulfilment of his will, and
paradise, where I may love him eternally. Is it possible
that thou wilt not hear me? No, already thou
dost hear me, as I hope; already thou art praying for
me, already thou art procuring me the favors I ask, already
thou art receiving me under thy protection. My
mother, do not leave me; continue, continue to pray for
me, until thou seest me safe in heaven at thy feet, to
bless and thank thee through all eternity. Amen.</p>

HOW READY MARY IS TO SUCCOR THOSE WHO CALL UPON HER.</h4>

<p>We poor children of the unhappy Eve, guilty before
God of her sin, and condemned to the same
punishment, go wandering through this valley of tears,
exiles from our country, weeping and afflicted by innumerable
pains of body and soul! But blessed is
he who in the midst of so many miseries turns to the
consoler of the world, to the refuge of the unhappy,
to the great mother of God, and devoutly invokes her
and supplicates her! “Blessed is the man that heareth
me, and that watcheth daily at my gates.”<a id="FNanchor_302" href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a>
Blessed, says Mary, is he who listens to my counsels,
and incessantly watches at the door of my mercy, invoking
my help and intercession! The holy Church
instructs us her children with how great attention and
confidence we should have continually recourse to this
our loving protectress; ordaining special devotions to
her, that during the year many festivals should be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
celebrated in her honor; that one day of the week
should be especially consecrated to her; that every
day, in the divine office, all ecclesiastics and members
of religious orders should invoke her in behalf of the
whole Christian people, and that three times a day all
the faithful, at the sound of the bell, should salute her.
This will suffice to show how, in all seasons of public
calamity, the holy Church always directs her children
to have recourse to the divine mother with novenas,
prayers, processions, visits to her churches and altars.
This, Mary herself wishes us to do, namely, always to
invoke and supplicate her, not to ask our homage and
praise, which are too poor in comparison with her
merit, but that our confidence and devotion to her
thus increasing, she may aid and console us more.
She seeks such as approach her devoutly and reverently,
says St. Bonaventure; these she cherishes, loves,
and adopts as her children.<a id="FNanchor_303" href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a></p>

<p>The same St. Bonaventure says, that Mary was
prefigured by Ruth, whose name, being interpreted,
signifies <i>seeing</i>, <i>hastening</i>;<a id="FNanchor_304" href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> for Mary, seeing our miseries,
hastens to aid us by her compassion.<a id="FNanchor_305" href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a> To which
Novarino adds, that Mary is so desirous to do us good,
that she can bear no delay; and not being a miserly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
keeper of her favors, but the mother of mercy, she
cannot restrain herself from dispensing, as soon as
possible among her servants, the treasures of her
liberality.<a id="FNanchor_306" href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a></p>

<p>Oh, how ready is this good mother to aid him who
invokes her! “Thy two breasts are like two young
roes.”<a id="FNanchor_307" href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a> Richard of St. Laurence, explaining this passage,
says that the breasts of Mary readily, like the
roe’s, give the milk of mercy to those who ask
it.<a id="FNanchor_308" href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a> The same author assures us that the mercy of
Mary is bestowed on all who ask it, though they
offer no prayer but a “Hail Mary.” Hence, Novarino
affirms, that the blessed Virgin not only hastens, but
flies to aid those who have recourse to her. She, says
this author, in exercising mercy, cannot but resemble
God; for, as the Lord hastens to succor those who
ask help from him, being very faithful to observe the
promise which he has made to us—Ask, and you shall
receive<a id="FNanchor_309" href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a>—so Mary, when she is invoked, immediately
hastens to help those who call upon her.<a id="FNanchor_310" href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a> And by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
this is explained who was the woman of the Apocalypse,
with two wings of a great eagle, that she might
fly into the desert.<a id="FNanchor_311" href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a> Ribeira explains these two wings
to signify the love with which Mary always hastens to
God.<a id="FNanchor_312" href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a> But the blessed Amadeus says, remarking on
this passage, that the wings of an eagle signify the
velocity with which Mary, surpassing in swiftness
the seraphs, always comes to the help of her
children.<a id="FNanchor_313" href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a></p>

<p>We read in the Gospel of St. Luke, that when Mary
went to visit St. Elisabeth, and bestow blessings on all
her family, she was not slow, but travelled that whole
journey with haste.<a id="FNanchor_314" href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a> But we do not read that it was
so on her return. For the same reason, it is said in
the sacred Canticles, that the hands of Mary are
turned.<a id="FNanchor_315" href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a> For, as Richard of St. Laurence explains
it, The art of turning is easier and quicker than other
arts, so Mary is more ready than any other of the
saints to aid her suppliants.<a id="FNanchor_316" href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a> She has the greatest
desire to console all, and she scarcely hears herself invoked
before she graciously receives the petition and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
comes to our aid.<a id="FNanchor_317" href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a> Justly, then, St. Bonaventure
calls Mary, The salvation of those who invoke her:
“O salus te invocantium!” signifying, that to be saved
it is sufficient to appeal to this divine mother, who,
according to Richard of St. Laurence, is always ready
to aid those who pray to her.<a id="FNanchor_318" href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> For, as St. Bernardine
de Bustis says: This great Lady is more desirous to
confer favors upon us than we are to receive them.<a id="FNanchor_319" href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a></p>

<p>Neither should the multitude of our sins diminish
our confidence that we shall be graciously heard by
Mary, if we cast ourselves at her feet. She is the
mother of mercy, and there would be no occasion for
mercy, if there were no wretchedness to be relieved.
Therefore, as a good mother does not hesitate to apply
a remedy to her child, however loathsome its disease,
although the cure may be troublesome and disgusting;
thus our good mother does not abandon us, when we
recur to her, however great may be the filth of our
sins, which she comes to cure.<a id="FNanchor_320" href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a> This sentiment is
taken from Richard of St. Laurence. And Mary
intended to signify the same when she appeared to St.
Gertrude, spreading her mantle to receive all who had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
recourse to her: at the same time it was given the saint
to understand, that the angels are waiting to defend the
devout suppliants of Mary from the assaults of hell.<a id="FNanchor_321" href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a></p>

<p>So great is the love and pity which this good mother
has for us, that she does not wait for our prayers before
giving us her aid. “She preventeth them that
covet her, so that she first showeth herself unto them.”<a id="FNanchor_322" href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a>
These words of wisdom St. Anselm applies to Mary,
and says that she anticipates those who desire her
protection. By this we are to understand, that she
obtains many graces from God for us before we ask
them from her. Therefore Richard of St. Victor
says: Mary is called the moon: Pulchra ut luna;<a id="FNanchor_323" href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a>
not only because she hastens as the moon to shine on
those who seek her light,<a id="FNanchor_324" href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> but because she so earnestly
desires our welfare that in our necessities she
anticipates our prayers, and in her compassion she is
more prompt to help us than we are to have recourse
to her.<a id="FNanchor_325" href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> For, adds the same Richard, the breast of
Mary is so full of pity that she scarcely knows our
miseries before she offers us the milk of her mercy,
neither can this gracious queen perceive the necessities
of any soul without relieving it.<a id="FNanchor_326" href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span></p>

<p>And truly, Mary manifested to us while she was on
earth, in the nuptials of Cana,<a id="FNanchor_327" href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> her great compassion
for our sufferings, which prompts her to relieve them
before we pray to her. This kind mother saw the
trouble of that pair who were mortified to find that
their wine had failed at the wedding banquet; and
without being requested, moved only by her compassionate
heart, which cannot look upon the afflictions
of others without pity, prayed her Son to console
them by merely mentioning to him the necessities of
the family: They have no wine:<a id="FNanchor_328" href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a> “Vinum non habent.”
After which, her Son, to comfort that family,
and still more to satisfy the compassionate heart of his
mother, performed, as she desired, the well-known miracle
of changing the water contained in vases into
wine. Novarino here remarks, that if Mary, though
unasked, is so ready to aid us in our necessities, how
much more so will she be when we invoke her and
implore her aid!<a id="FNanchor_329" href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a></p>

<p>If any one doubts that he shall be assisted by Mary
when he has recourse to her, let him listen to the
words of Innocent III.: Who has ever invoked this
sweet Lady, and has not been heard by her?<a id="FNanchor_330" href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a> Who,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
oh holy Virgin, exclaims the blessed Eutychian,
has ever sought thy powerful protection, which can
relieve the most miserable and rescue the most degraded,
and has been abandoned by thee? No, this
has never happened, and never will happen.<a id="FNanchor_331" href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> Let
him be silent concerning thy mercy, oh blessed Virgin,
whose necessities have been neglected by thee
after he has implored thy aid.<a id="FNanchor_332" href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a></p>

<p>Sooner will heaven and earth be destroyed, says
the devout Blosius, than Mary fail to aid those who,
with a pure intention, recommend themselves to her
and put their confidence in her.<a id="FNanchor_333" href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a> And to increase our
confidence, St. Anselm adds, that when we have recourse
to this divine mother, we may not only be sure
of her protection, but that sometimes we shall be
sooner heard and saved by invoking her holy name
than that of Jesus our Saviour.<a id="FNanchor_334" href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a> And he gives
this reason: Because it belongs to Christ, as our
judge, to punish, but to Mary, as our advocate,
to pity.<a id="FNanchor_335" href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a> By this he would give us to understand,
that we sooner find salvation by recurring to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
the mother than the Son; not because Mary is more
powerful than her Son to save us, for we know that
Jesus is our only Saviour, and that by his merits alone
he has obtained and does obtain for us salvation; but because
when we have recourse to Jesus, considering him
also as the judge to whom it belongs to punish the ungrateful,
we may lose the confidence necessary to be
heard; but going to Mary, who has no other office
than that of exercising compassion towards us as
mother of mercy, and defending us as our advocate,
our confidence will be more secure and greater.
We ask many things of God and do not obtain them;
we ask them from Mary and obtain them; how is
this? Nicephorus answers: This does not happen because
Mary is more powerful than God, but because
God has seen fit thus to honor his mother.<a id="FNanchor_336" href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a></p>

<p>How consoling is the promise that our Lord himself
made on this subject to St. Bridget! We read in her
revelations, that one day this saint heard Jesus speaking
with his mother, and that he said to her: “My
mother, ask of me whatever thou wilt, for I will refuse
nothing that thou dost ask;<a id="FNanchor_337" href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a> and be assured,” he
added, “that all those who for love of thee seek any
favor, although they are sinners, if they desire to
amend, I promise to hear them.”<a id="FNanchor_338" href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a> The same thing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
was revealed to St. Gertrude, who heard our Redeemer
himself say to Mary, that he had in his
omnipotence permitted her to exercise mercy towards
sinners who invoke her, in whatever manner it should
please her.<a id="FNanchor_339" href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a></p>

<p>Every one invoking this mother of mercy may then
say, with St. Augustine: “Remember, oh most compassionate
Lady! that since the beginning of the
world there never has been any one abandoned by
thee. Therefore pardon me if I say that I do not
wish to be the first sinner who has sought thy aid
in vain.”<a id="FNanchor_340" href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a></p>

<h5>EXAMPLE.</h5>

<p>St. Francis of Sales, as we read in his life, efficaciously
experienced the power of this prayer. At seventeen
years of age he was living in Paris, engaged in study,
and at the same time wholly devoted to pious exercises
and holy love of God, which gave him a perpetual foretaste
of heavenly joy. At this time the Lord, to try his
faith, and attach him more strongly to his love, permitted
the devil to represent to him that his efforts were in
vain, because he was already condemned by the divine
decree. The darkness and dryness in which it pleased
God to leave him at the time for he was insensible to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
all consoling thoughts of the divine goodness, caused
this temptation to have more power over the heart of
the holy youth; so that through great fear and desolation
he lost his appetite, sleep, color, and cheerfulness,
and excited the compassion of all those who looked
upon him.</p>

<p>Whilst this horrible conflict lasted, the saint could
conceive no other thoughts and utter no other words
but those of sorrow and distrust. “Shall I, then,”
he said, as it is related in his life, “be deprived of the
favor of my God, who hitherto has shown himself so
gracious and so kind to me? Oh love! oh beauty!
to which I have consecrated all my affections, shall
I never more enjoy your consolations? Oh Virgin
mother of God, the most beautiful of all the daughters
of Jerusalem, am I then never to see thee in
paradise? Ah, my Lady! if I am never to see thy
lovely face, do not permit me to be forced to blaspheme
and curse thee in hell.” These were the tender
sentiments of that afflicted heart, still so enamored
of God and the Virgin. This temptation lasted for a
month, but at length the Lord was pleased to deliver
him from it by means of the consoler of the world,
most holy Mary, to whom the saint had before made
a vow of chastity, and upon whom he used to say
he had placed all his hopes. One evening, on returning
home, he entered a church, where he saw a small
tablet suspended from the wall; he found written on
it the prayer of St. Augustine above mentioned: “Remember,
oh most merciful Mary! that no one, in any<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
age, was ever known to have fled to thee for help and
found himself abandoned.” He prostrated himself
before the altar of the divine mother, and recited with
deep feeling this prayer; he renewed his vow of chastity,
promised to recite daily the rosary, and then
added: “Oh my queen, be my advocate with thy
Son, whom I dare not approach. My mother, if in
the other world I should be so unhappy as not to be
able to love my Lord, whom I know is so worthy
to be loved, at least obtain for me that I may love
him as much as I can in this world. This is the grace
that I ask of thee, and from thee I hope for it.”
Thus he supplicated the Virgin, and then abandoned
himself to the divine mercy, resigning himself entirely
to the will of God. But hardly had he finished his
prayer, when by his most sweet mother he was suddenly
freed from temptation; he immediately recovered
his interior peace, and with it health of body, and
from that time continued to live a most devout servant
of Mary, whose praises and mercies he never ceased
to proclaim in his preaching and his writings to the
end of his life.</p>

<h5>PRAYER.</h5>

<p>Oh mother of God! oh queen of angels! oh hope
of men! listen to him who invokes thee and has recourse
to thee. Behold me to-day prostrate at thy
feet; I, a miserable slave of hell, consecrate myself
to thee as thy servant forever, offering myself to serve
and honor thee to the utmost of my power all the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
days of my life. I know that thy honor is not increased
by the service of so vile and wretched a slave
as I am, who have so grievously offended thy Son and
my Redeemer, Jesus. But if thou wilt accept one so
unworthy as I for thy servant, and, changing him by
thy intercession, wilt render him worthy, thy own compassion
will confer upon thee that honor which I, vile
as I am, cannot render thee. Accept me, then, and
do not reject me, oh my mother! The eternal Word
came from heaven upon earth to seek the lost sheep,
and to save them, became thy Son. And wilt thou
despise a poor sheep, who comes to thee to help him
find Jesus? The price has already been paid for my
salvation; my Saviour has shed his blood, which is
enough to save infinite worlds. It only remains that
this blood should be applied to me; and to thee it
belongs, oh blessed Virgin! to thee it belongs, as St.
Bernard says, to bestow the merits of this blood on
whomsoever it may please thee. To thee it belongs,
as St. Bonaventure also says, to save whom thou wilt.<a id="FNanchor_341" href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a>
Oh my queen, help me, then! my queen, save me!
To you this day I commit my soul; and do thou secure
its safety. Oh, salvation of those who invoke thee!
I will exclaim with the same saint, save me.<a id="FNanchor_342" href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a></p>

<h4 id="CHAPTER_IV_SECTION_II">SECTION II.<br>
HOW POWERFUL IS MARY IN PROTECTING THOSE WHO INVOKE HER IN
TEMPTATIONS OF THE DEVIL.</h4>

<p>Not only most holy Mary is queen of heaven and
of the saints, but also of hell and the devils, for she
has bravely triumphed over them by her virtues.
From the beginning of the world God predicted to
the infernal serpent the victory and the empire which
our queen would obtain over him, when he announced
to him that a woman would come into the world who
should conquer him. “I will put enmities between
thee and the woman; she shall crush thy head.”<a id="FNanchor_343" href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a>
And what woman was this enemy if not Mary, who,
with her beautiful humility and holy life, always conquered
him and destroyed his forces? St. Cyprian
affirms that the mother of our Lord Jesus Christ was
promised in that woman:<a id="FNanchor_344" href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a> and hence he remarks, that
God did not use the words I put, but I will put, lest
the prophecy should seem to appertain to Eve.<a id="FNanchor_345" href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a> He
said, I will put enmity between thee and the woman,
to signify that this his vanquisher was not the living
Eve, but must be another woman descending from her,
who was to bring to our first parents greater blessings,
as St. Vincent Ferrer says, than those they had lost by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
their sin.<a id="FNanchor_346" href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a> Mary, then, is this great and strong
woman who has conquered the devil, and has crushed
his head by subduing his pride, as the Lord added:
“She shall crash thy head.”<a id="FNanchor_347" href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a> Some of the commentators
doubt whether these words refer to Mary or to
Jesus Christ, because in the Septuagint version we
read: “He shall crush thy head.”<a id="FNanchor_348" href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a> But in our Vulgate,
which is the only version approved by the Council
of Trent, it is She, and not He. And thus St.
Ambrose, St. Jerome, St. Augustine, St. John Chrysostom,
and many others have understood it. However
this may be, it is certain that the Son by means
of the mother, or the mother by means of the Son,
has vanquished Lucifer; so that this proud spirit, as
St. Bernard tells us, has been ignominiously overpowered
and crushed by this blessed Virgin.<a id="FNanchor_349" href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a> Hence as
a slave conquered in war, he is forced always to obey
the commands of this queen. St. Bruno says, that
Eve, by yielding to the serpent, brought into the world
death and darkness; but that the blessed Virgin, by
conquering the devil, brought us life and light: and
she has bound him so that he cannot move to do the
least harm to her servants.<a id="FNanchor_350" href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span></p>

<p>Richard of St. Laurence gives a beautiful explanation
to these words of Proverbs: “The heart of her
husband trusteth in her, and he shall have no need of
spoils.”<a id="FNanchor_351" href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a> Richard says: The heart of her husband,
that is, Christ, trusts in her, and he shall have no need
of spoils, for she will endow him with the spoils which
she has taken from the devil.<a id="FNanchor_352" href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a> God has intrusted
the heart of Jesus, as à Lapide expresses it, to the care
of Mary, that she may procure for it the love of men;
and thus he will not be in need of spoils, that is, of
the conquest of souls, for she will enrich him with
those souls of which she despoils hell, and which she
has rescued from the demons by her powerful aid.</p>

<p>It is well known that the palm is the emblem of
victory, and for this reason our queen has been placed
on a high throne in the sight of all potentates, as
a palm, the sign of certain victory, which all can
promise themselves who have recourse to her. “I
was exalted like a palm-tree in Cades.”<a id="FNanchor_353" href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a> That is, for
a defence,<a id="FNanchor_354" href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a> as blessed Albertus Magnus says: Oh,
my children, Mary seems to say to us with these
words, when the enemy assails you, lift your eyes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
to me, behold me and take courage; for in me, who
defends you, you will behold, at the same time, your
victory. So that recourse to Mary is the most certain
means of overcoming all the assaults of hell; for
she, as St. Bernardine of Sienna says, is queen over
hell, and ruler of the spirits of evil, for she controls
and conquers them.<a id="FNanchor_355" href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a> And therefore Mary is called
terrible against the power of hell, as an army set in
array. “Terrible as an army set in array.”<a id="FNanchor_356" href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a> Set in
array, because she knows how to array her powers,
that is, her compassion and her prayers, to the confusion
of the enemy and the benefit of her servants, who,
in their temptations, invoke her powerful aid.</p>

<p>“As the vine I have brought forth a pleasant
odor.”<a id="FNanchor_357" href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a> “I, like the vine, as the Holy Spirit puts it
in her mouth to say, have given fruits of sweet odor.”
“It is said,” adds St. Bernard, on this passage, “that
every venomous reptile shuns the flowering vines.”<a id="FNanchor_358" href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a>
As from vines all poisonous serpents flee, thus the
demons flee from those fortunate souls in whom they
perceive the odor of devotion to Mary. On this account
she also is called a cedar: “I was exalted like
a cedar in Libanus,”<a id="FNanchor_359" href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a> not only because as the cedar is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
free from corruption, so Mary is free from sin, but
also because, as Cardinal Hugo remarks upon this passage,
as the cedar with its perfume puts serpents to
flight, so Mary with her sanctity puts to flight the
devils.<a id="FNanchor_360" href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a></p>

<p>Victories were gained in Judea by means of the ark.
Thus Moses conquered his enemies. “When the ark
was lifted up, Moses said, Arise, oh Lord, and let
thy enemies be scattered.”<a id="FNanchor_361" href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a> Thus Jericho was conquered;
thus were the Philistines conquered; “for
the ark of God was there.”<a id="FNanchor_362" href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a> It is well known that
this ark was the type of Mary. As the ark contained
the manna, thus Mary contained Jesus, whom the
manna also prefigured, and by means of this ark, victories
were gained over the enemies of earth and over
hell.<a id="FNanchor_363" href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a> Wherefore St. Bernardine of Sienna says that
when Mary, the ark of the New Testament, was
crowned queen of heaven, the power of hell over men
was weakened and overthrown.<a id="FNanchor_364" href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a></p>

<p>“Oh, how the devils in hell,” says St. Bonaventure,
“tremble at Mary and her great name!”<a id="FNanchor_365" href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a> The saint
compares these enemies to those of whom Job makes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
mention and says: “He diggeth through houses in
the dark.... If the morning suddenly appear, it is
to them the shadow of death.”<a id="FNanchor_366" href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a> Thieves enter houses
in the dark to rob them, but when the dawn comes
they flee, as if the image of death appeared to them.
In the same manner, as St. Bonaventure expresses it,
the demons enter into the soul in times of darkness,
that is, when the soul is obscured by ignorance; they
dig through the houses of our minds in the darkness
of ignorance; but then, he adds, as soon as the grace
and the mercy of Mary enter the soul, this beautiful
aurora dissipates the darkness, and the infernal enemies
flee as at the approach of death.<a id="FNanchor_367" href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a> Oh, blessed is
he who always, in his conflicts with hell, invokes the
beautiful name of Mary!</p>

<p>In confirmation of this it was revealed to St. Bridget
that God has given Mary such power over all evil
spirits, that whenever they assail any of her servants
who implore her aid, at the slightest sign from her
they flee far away in terror, preferring that their pains
should be redoubled rather than that Mary should
domineer over them in this manner.<a id="FNanchor_368" href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span></p>

<p>À Lapide remarks upon the words with which the
divine spouse praises his beloved bride, when he calls
her the lily, and says that as the lily is among thorns,
so is his beloved among the other daughters;<a id="FNanchor_369" href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a> that, as
the lily is a remedy against serpents and poisons, so the
invocation of Mary is a special remedy for overcoming
all temptations, particularly those of impurity, as they
who have tried it have universally experienced.<a id="FNanchor_370" href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a></p>

<p>St. John of Damascus said, and every one may say
the same who is so happy as to be devoted to this
great queen: Oh, mother of God, if I trust in thee,
I shall surely not be vanquished; for, defended by
thee, I will pursue my enemies, and opposing to them
thy protection and thy powerful support as a shield,
I shall surely conquer them.<a id="FNanchor_371" href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a> James the Monk, reputed
a doctor among the Greek fathers, discoursing
of Mary to our Lord, says: Thou, oh my Lord, hast
given us this mother for a powerful defence against
all our enemies.<a id="FNanchor_372" href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span></p>

<p>It is related in the Old Testament that the Lord
guided his people from Egypt to the promised land,
by day in a pillar of cloud, by night in a pillar of
fire.<a id="FNanchor_373" href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a> This pillar, now of clouds, now of fire, says
Richard of St. Laurence, was a type of Mary and her
double office, which she exercises continually in our
behalf; as a cloud she protects us from the heat of
divine justice, and as fire she protects us from demons.<a id="FNanchor_374" href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a>
Fire, as St. Bonaventure adds, for as wax
melts at the approach of fire, thus the evil spirits lose
all power in the presence of those souls who often
call upon the name of Mary, and devoutly invoke her,
and more than all, strive to imitate her.<a id="FNanchor_375" href="#Footnote_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a></p>

<p>Oh, how the devils tremble, exclaims St. Bernard,
if they only hear the name of Mary uttered!<a id="FNanchor_376" href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a> As
men, says Thomas à Kempis, fall to the earth through
fear, when a thunderbolt strikes near them, so fall
prostrate the devils when but the name of Mary is
heard.<a id="FNanchor_377" href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a> How many noble victories have the servants<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
of Mary not gained over these enemies by the power
of her most holy name! Thus St. Anthony of Padua
conquered them, thus the blessed Henry Suso, thus
many other lovers of Mary. It is related in the accounts
of the missions to Japan, that a great number
of demons appeared in the form of ferocious animals
to a certain Christian of that country, to alarm him
and threaten him, but he spoke to them in these
words: “I have no arms with which to terrify you; if
the Most High permits it, do with me according to
your pleasure. Meanwhile I use as my defence the
most sweet names of Jesus and Mary.” Hardly had
he uttered these words, when behold, at the sound of
those fearful names, the earth opened and those proud
spirits were swallowed up. St. Anselm also asserts
that he had seen and heard many persons who at the
mention of the name of Mary were delivered from
their dangers.<a id="FNanchor_378" href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a></p>

<p>Very glorious, oh Mary, and wonderful exclaims St.
Bonaventure, is thy great name. Those who are
mindful to utter it at the hour of death, have nothing
to fear from hell, for the devils at once abandon the
soul when they hear the name of Mary.<a id="FNanchor_379" href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a> And the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
saint adds, that an earthly enemy does not so greatly
fear a great army, as the powers of hell fear the name
and protection of Mary.<a id="FNanchor_380" href="#Footnote_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a> Thou, oh Lady, says St.
Germanus, by the invocation alone of thy most powerful
name, dost render thy servants secure from all
the assaults of the enemy.<a id="FNanchor_381" href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a> Oh, if Christians were
only mindful in temptations to invoke with confidence
the name of Mary, it is certain that they would never
fall; for, as blessed Alanus remarks, at the thunder
of that great name, the devil flees and hell trembles.<a id="FNanchor_382" href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a>
This heavenly queen herself revealed to St. Bridget,
that even from the most abandoned sinners, who had
wandered the farthest from God, and were most fully
possessed by the devil, the enemy departs as soon as
he hears her most powerful name invoked by them, if
they do it with a true intention of amending.<a id="FNanchor_383" href="#Footnote_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a> But
the Virgin added, that if the soul does not amend,
and with contrition quit its sins, the demons immediately
return to it and hold it in their possession.<a id="FNanchor_384" href="#Footnote_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span></p>

<h5>EXAMPLE.</h5>

<p>In Reisberg there lived a Canon regular named
Arnold, who was very devoted to the blessed Virgin.
Being at the point of death, he received the
sacraments, and calling his religious to him, begged
them not to leave him at the last moment. Scarcely
had he said this, when he began to tremble violently
and roll his eyes; cold sweat fell from him, and with
an agitated voice he exclaimed: “Do you not see
those demons who would seize me and carry me to
hell?” Then he cried: “My brothers, invoke for me
the help of Mary; I trust in her that she will give
me the victory.” They immediately began to recite
the Litany of our Lady, and at the words, Holy Mary,
pray for him, “Sancta Maria, ora pro eo,” the dying man
cried: “Repeat, repeat the name of Mary, for I am
even now at the tribunal of God.” He stopped for a
moment, and then added: “It is true that I did it, but I
have done penance for it.” Then turning to the Virgin,
he said: “Oh Mary, I shall be delivered if thou
wilt help me.” The demons soon after made another
attack, but he defended himself by blessing himself
with the crucifix, and invoking Mary. Thus he passed
the whole night, but when morning dawned, Arnold,
restored to serenity, joyfully said: “Mary, my Lady
and my refuge, has obtained for me pardon and salvation.”
Then beholding the Virgin, who summoned
him to follow her, he said: “I come, oh Lady, I come.”
He made an effort to rise, but not being able to follow<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
her with the body, gently expiring, he followed her
with his soul, as we hope, to the blessed kingdom of
glory.<a id="FNanchor_385" href="#Footnote_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a></p>

<h5>PRAYER.</h5>

<p>Behold at thy feet, oh Mary my hope, a poor sinner
who many times, through his own fault, has
been the slave of hell. I know that I have often been
conquered by the devil, because I have neglected to
recur to thee, oh my refuge. If I had always sought
thy protection, if I had invoked thee, I should never
have fallen. I hope, oh my Lady, most worthy of
love, that by thy help I have escaped the powers of
hell, and that God has pardoned me. But I tremble
for the future, lest I again fall into their power. I
know that these enemies of mine have not lost all
hope of reconquering me, and at this moment they
are preparing new assaults and temptations. Oh, my
queen and refuge, aid me. Shelter me beneath thy
mantle, let me not become again their slave. I know
that thou wilt succor me and give me victory whenever
I invoke thee. I fear only that in my temptations
I may forget thee, and neglect to call upon thee.
This, then, is the grace, oh most holy Virgin, that I
seek and wish from thee, that I may always remember
thee, and especially when I find myself in conflict
with the enemy; let me not then fail to invoke thee
often with the words: “Oh Mary, help me, help me,
oh Mary.” And when at length the day of my last<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
conflict with hell, the day of my death arrives, oh, my
queen, powerfully assist me then, and remind me thyself
to invoke thee more frequently, with the voice or
with the heart, that expiring with thy most sweet
name, and that of thy son Jesus on my lips, I may go
to bless and praise thee, and never leave thy feet in
paradise through all eternity. Amen.</p>

THE NEED WE HAVE OF THE INTERCESSION OF MARY FOR OUR
SALVATION.</h4>

<p>To invoke and pray to the saints, especially to the
queen of saints, most holy Mary, that they may obtain
for us, by their intercession, the divine favor, is
not only a lawful but a useful and holy practice, and
this is of faith, being established by the Councils,
against heretics, who condemn it as injurious to Jesus
Christ, who is our only mediator; but if a Jeremias,
after his death, prays for Jerusalem<a id="FNanchor_386" href="#Footnote_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a>; if the elders of
the Apocalypse present to God the prayers of the
saints; if a St. Peter promises his disciples to remember
them after his death; if a St. Stephen prays for
his persecutors; if a St. Paul prays for his companions;
if, in a word, the saints pray for us, why may<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
we not implore the saints to intercede for us? St.
Paul commends himself to the prayers of his disciples:
Pray for us: “Orate pro nobis.”<a id="FNanchor_387" href="#Footnote_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a> St. James exhorts
the Christians to pray for each other: “Pray for one
another, that ye may be saved.”<a id="FNanchor_388" href="#Footnote_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a> We may then do
likewise.</p>

<p>No one will deny that Jesus Christ is the only mediator
of justice, and that by his merits he has obtained
for us reconciliation with God. But, on the other
hand, it is impious to deny that God is pleased to
grant favors at the intercession of the saints, and especially
of Mary his mother, whom Jesus desires so
much to see loved and honored by us. Every one
knows that honor paid to a mother redounds to her
children.<a id="FNanchor_389" href="#Footnote_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a> Hence St. Bernard says, let not any one
think that by greatly praising the mother he will throw
into the shade the glories of the Son; for the more he
honors the mother, so much more he honors the Son.<a id="FNanchor_390" href="#Footnote_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a>
St. Ildephonsus says, that all the honor which is paid
to the mother and the queen, is rendered to the Son
and king.<a id="FNanchor_391" href="#Footnote_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a> And there is no doubt that on account
of the merits of Jesus, the great privilege has been
granted to Mary to be the mediatrix of our salvation;
not, indeed, mediatrix of justice, but of grace and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
intercession, as she is called by St. Bonaventure.<a id="FNanchor_392" href="#Footnote_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a>
St. Lawrence Justinian also says: Can she be otherwise
than full of grace, who has been made the ladder
of paradise, the gate of heaven, the most true
mediatrix between God and man?<a id="FNanchor_393" href="#Footnote_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a></p>

<p>Wherefore St. Anselm well remarks, that when we
implore the holy Virgin to obtain graces for us, it is
not that we distrust the divine mercy, but rather that
we distrust our own unworthiness, and commend ourselves
to Mary that her merits may compensate for
our unworthiness.<a id="FNanchor_394" href="#Footnote_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a></p>

<p>It cannot be doubted, therefore, except by those
who are deficient in faith, that it is a useful and holy
thing to have recourse to the intercession of Mary.
But the point that we here propose to prove is, that the
intercession of Mary is even necessary for our salvation;
necessary, to speak properly, not indeed absolutely,
but morally. And we affirm that this necessity arises
from the will of God itself, who has ordained that all
the favors which he dispenses should pass through the
hands of Mary, according to the opinion of St. Bernard,
which may well be considered at the present
day the common opinion of doctors and divines,
as the author of “The kingdom of Mary” has<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
already called it. It is embraced by Vega, Mendoza,
Paciucchelli, Segneri, Poiré, Crasset, and innumerable
other learned authors. Even Father Noel Alexander,
an author usually very reserved in his assertions, declares
it to be the will of God that we receive all
favors through the intercession of Mary.<a id="FNanchor_395" href="#Footnote_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a> In confirmation
of this, he quotes the celebrated passage of St.
Bernard: This is the will of him who would have us
receive all things through Mary.<a id="FNanchor_396" href="#Footnote_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a> The same opinion
is held by Father Contensone, who, explaining the
words of Jesus Christ on the cross to John, Behold
thy mother, “Ecce mater tua,” says: It
is as if he said, no one shall partake of my blood except
by the intercession of my mother. My wounds
are fountains of grace, but to none can their streams
be conveyed except by the channel of Mary. Oh
John, my disciple, even as thou lovest my mother, so
shalt thou be loved by me.<a id="FNanchor_397" href="#Footnote_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a></p>

<p>The statement that whatsoever we receive from the
Lord comes to us by means of Mary, does not find
favor with a certain modern author, who, although he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
treats with much piety and learning of true and false
devotion, yet speaking of the devotion towards the divine
mother, has shown himself very sparing in granting
her the glory that a St. Germanus, a St. Anselm,
a St. John of Damascus, a St. Bonaventure, a St.
Antoninus, a St. Bernardine of Sienna, the venerable
Abbot of Celles, and so many other doctors, have not
hesitated to attribute to her, who have not scrupled
to declare that for the above-mentioned reason the
intercession of Mary is not only useful, but necessary.
The above-named author says that this proposition,
namely, that God grants no favors except through
Mary, is an hyperbole and an exaggeration which has
escaped from the mouth of some saints in a moment
of fervor, and properly speaking, is to be understood
only in the sense that through Mary we have received
Jesus Christ, by whose merits we receive all graces.
Otherwise, he continues, it would be an error to believe
that God could not grant graces without the intercession
of Mary, since the apostle says: “There is
one God and one Mediator of God and men, the
man Christ Jesus.”<a id="FNanchor_398" href="#Footnote_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a> So far the above-named author.</p>

<p>But with his leave I will suggest to him what he
himself in his book teaches me, that the mediation of
justice by means of merit, and the mediation of grace
by means of prayer, are very different things. Thus
it is also one thing to say that God cannot, another to
say he will not grant favors without the intercession
of Mary. We willingly acknowledge that God is the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
fountain of every good, and absolute Lord of all
graces, and that Mary is only a pure creature who,
through grace, receives whatever she obtains from
God. But who can deny it to be reasonable and
proper to assert that God, in order to exalt this noble
creature, who, more than all other creatures, has loved
and honored him in her life, having chosen her for the
mother of his Son the Redeemer of the world, has
also seen fit to dispense through her hands all the
graces which are to be granted to redeemed souls?
We acknowledge that Jesus Christ is the only mediator
of justice, as we have stated above, who by his
merits obtains for us grace and salvation; but we affirm
that Mary is the mediatrix of grace, and although
whatever she obtains, she obtains through the merits
of Jesus Christ, and because she prays and asks for it
in the name of Jesus Christ, yet whatever favors we
ask are all obtained through her intercession.</p>

<p>In this there is certainly nothing opposed to the
sacred doctrines; on the contrary, it is entirely conformed
to the sentiments of the Church, who, in the
public prayers, by her approved, teaches us to appeal
constantly to this divine mother, and invoke her as the
Health of the weak: “Salus infirmorum.” The
Refuge of sinners: “Refugium peccatorum.” The
Help of Christians: “Auxilium christianorum.” Our
life and our hope: “Vita et spes nostra.” The same
holy Church, in the office which she requires to be recited
on the Festivals of Mary, applying to her the
words of Wisdom, gives us to understand that in Mary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
we shall find every hope: “In me is all hope of life
and virtue.”<a id="FNanchor_399" href="#Footnote_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a> That in Mary we shall find every
grace: “In me is all grace of the way and of the
truth.”<a id="FNanchor_400" href="#Footnote_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a> In a word, that we shall find in Mary life
and eternal salvation: “He that shall find me shall
find life, and shall have salvation from the Lord.”<a id="FNanchor_401" href="#Footnote_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a>
And again: “They that work by me shall not sin.
They that explain me shall have life everlasting.”<a id="FNanchor_402" href="#Footnote_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a>
All which passages signify the need we have of the
intercession of Mary.</p>

<p>This then is the sentiment in which so many theologians
and holy fathers concur, of whom we cannot
with justice say, as the author quoted above has
asserted, that to exalt Mary they have uttered <i>hyperboles</i>,
and that <i>excessive exaggerations</i> have fallen
from their lips. To exaggerate and utter hyperboles,
is to exceed the limits of truth, which cannot be said
of the saints who have spoken, enlightened by the
Spirit of God, who is the Spirit of truth. And here, if
I may make a brief digression, let me express a sentiment
of mine, namely: when an opinion is in any
way honorable to the most holy Virgin, and has some
foundation, and is not repugnant to the faith and the
decrees of the Church, and to the truth; the rejection<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
of it, and opposition to it, because the contrary may
also be true, indicates little devotion to the mother of
God. I would not be one of the number of these,
nor would I see you, my reader, one of them, but
rather of the number of those who fully and firmly
believe all that can be believed, without error, concerning
the greatness of Mary, as the Abbot Rupert
says, who places among the offerings of devotion most
pleasing to this mother, that of a firm belief in her
great privileges.<a id="FNanchor_403" href="#Footnote_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a> If no one else, St. Augustine at
least might remove from us all fear of exaggeration
in the praise of Mary, who asserts that all we may
say in her praise is little in comparison with what she
merits on account of her dignity as mother of God.
The holy Church also, in the Mass of the blessed
Virgin, requires these words to be read: “For thou
art happy, oh sacred Virgin Mary, and most worthy
of all praise.”<a id="FNanchor_404" href="#Footnote_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a></p>

<p>But let us return to our subject, and hear what the
saints say of the opinion in question. St. Bernard
says that God has bestowed all graces on Mary, that
men, through her as through a channel, may receive
whatever good is in store for them.<a id="FNanchor_405" href="#Footnote_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a> Moreover, the
saint here makes an important reflection, and says that
before the birth of the most holy Virgin there flowed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
no such current of grace for all, since this desired channel
did not yet exist.<a id="FNanchor_406" href="#Footnote_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a> But for this end, he adds, Mary
has been given to the world, that through this channel
the divine graces might continually flow down
upon us.<a id="FNanchor_407" href="#Footnote_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a></p>

<p>As Holofernes, in order to gain the city of Bethulia,
directed the aqueducts to be broken, so the devil
makes every effort to deprive souls of their devotion
to the mother of God; for, if this channel of grace
were closed, he could easily succeed in gaining them
to himself. The same holy father continues, and says:
Observe, then, oh souls, with what affection and devotion
the Lord would have us honor this our queen, by
always seeking and confiding in her protection; for in
her he has placed the fulness of all good, that henceforth
we may recognize as coming from Mary whatever
of hope, grace, or salvation we receive.<a id="FNanchor_408" href="#Footnote_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a> St.
Antoninus says the same thing: All the mercies ever
bestowed upon men have all come through Mary.<a id="FNanchor_409" href="#Footnote_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a></p>

<p>For this reason she is called the moon, because, as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
St. Bonaventure remarks, as the moon is between the
sun and the earth, and reflects upon the latter what
she receives from the former, so Mary receives the
celestial influences of grace from the divine Son, to
transfuse them into us who are upon the earth.<a id="FNanchor_410" href="#Footnote_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a></p>

<p>For this reason, too, she is called the gate of heaven
by the holy Church: “Felix cœli porta;” because,
St. Bernard again observes, as every rescript of grace
sent by the king comes through the palace gate, so it
is given to Mary, that through her thou shouldst receive
whatever thou hast.<a id="FNanchor_411" href="#Footnote_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a> St. Bonaventure, moreover,
says that Mary is called the gate of heaven, because
no one can enter heaven if he does not pass
through Mary, who is the door of it.<a id="FNanchor_412" href="#Footnote_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a></p>

<p>St. Jerome confirms us in the same sentiment (or,
as some persons think, another ancient author of a
sermon upon the Assumption, which is inserted among
the works of St. Jerome), when he says, that in Jesus
Christ was the fulness of grace as in the head, whence
descend to the members, which we are, all the vital
spirits, that is, the divine aids for attaining eternal salvation;
in Mary likewise was fulness as in the neck,
through which those vital spirits pass to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
members.<a id="FNanchor_413" href="#Footnote_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a> This is confirmed by St. Bernardine of Sienna,
who more clearly unfolded this thought, saying that
through Mary are transmitted to the faithful, who are
the mystic body of Jesus Christ, all the graces of the
spiritual life, which descend upon them from Jesus
their head.<a id="FNanchor_414" href="#Footnote_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a></p>

<p>St. Bonaventure also attempts to assign the reason
for this when he says: God being pleased to dwell
in the womb of this holy Virgin, she has acquired
thereby, in a certain sense, a kind of jurisdiction over
all graces; since Jesus came from her sacred womb,
together with him proceed from her, as from a celestial
ocean, all the streams of divine gifts.<a id="FNanchor_415" href="#Footnote_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a> St. Bernardine
of Sienna expresses this in even clearer terms. From
the time, he asserts, that this mother conceived in her
womb the Divine Word, she acquired, if we may thus
express it, a special right to the gifts which proceed
to us from the Holy Spirit, so that no creature has received
any grace from God except by the intervention
and hand of Mary.<a id="FNanchor_416" href="#Footnote_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span></p>

<p>And thus is explained by a certain author<a id="FNanchor_417" href="#Footnote_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a> that
passage of Jeremias where the prophet, speaking of
the incarnation of the Word and of Mary his mother,
says, that “a woman shall compass a man.”<a id="FNanchor_418" href="#Footnote_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a> The
author above named explains this to mean that, as no
line proceeds from the centre of a circle which does
not pass through its circumference; thus no grace
comes to us from Jesus, who is the centre of every
good, that does not pass through Mary, who encompassed
him after she had received him in her womb.</p>

<p>Hence, says St. Bernardine, all gifts, all virtues,
and all graces, are dispensed by Mary<a id="FNanchor_419" href="#Footnote_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a> to whom she
will, when she will, and in the manner she will.
Richard likewise says, that God wishes all the good
he bestows on creatures to pass through the hands of
Mary.<a id="FNanchor_420" href="#Footnote_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a> Hence the venerable Abbot of Celles exhorts
every one to have recourse to this treasurer of graces,
as he calls her: “Thesaurariam gratiarum;” for only
by her means the world and men are to receive all the
good they may hope for.<a id="FNanchor_421" href="#Footnote_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a> By which it is evident<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
that the saints and authors above quoted, in saying
that all graces come to us through Mary, have not intended
to say this only because we have received from
Mary, Jesus Christ, who is the fountain of every good,
as the author named above would imply; but they
assure us that God, after having given us Jesus Christ,
has decreed that all the graces which have been dispensed,
are dispensed, and shall be dispensed to men,
even to the end of the world, through the merits of
Jesus, shall be dispensed through the hands and by
the intercession of Mary.</p>

<p>Hence Father Suarez concludes it to be the universal
sentiment of the Church at the present day, that
the intercession of Mary is not only useful, but necessary.<a id="FNanchor_422" href="#Footnote_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a>
Necessary, as we said before, not in the sense
of absolute necessity, because only the mediation of
Jesus Christ is absolutely necessary for us, but in the
sense of moral necessity; for the Church holds the
opinion, with St. Bernard, that God has chosen to bestow
no grace upon us but by the hands of Mary.<a id="FNanchor_423" href="#Footnote_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a>
St. Ildephonsus affirmed this before St. Bernard, when,
addressing the Virgin, he says: Oh Mary, God has
decreed to commit to thee all the favors that he would
confer upon men; hence he has confided to thee all
the treasures and riches of grace.<a id="FNanchor_424" href="#Footnote_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a> And therefore St.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
Peter Damian says,<a id="FNanchor_425" href="#Footnote_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a> that God would not become
man without the consent of Mary, that, in the first
place, we might remain greatly indebted to her; and
secondly, that we might understand the salvation of
all men to be made dependent upon her good pleasure.</p>

<p>St. Bonaventure, contemplating the words of Isaias,
where the prophet says: From the race of Jesse
there shall come forth a rod—that is, Mary; and
from that the flower—that is, the Word incarnate,<a id="FNanchor_426" href="#Footnote_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a>
utters these beautiful words: Let him who would obtain
the grace of the Holy Spirit, seek the flower in
the rod, Jesus in Mary; since by the rod we obtain
the flower, and by the flower we find God.<a id="FNanchor_427" href="#Footnote_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a> And he
afterwards adds: If thou wouldst have this flower,
strive, with prayers, to incline the stem of the flower
in thy favor, and thou wilt obtain it.<a id="FNanchor_428" href="#Footnote_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a> The seraphic
Doctor, also commenting on the words: “They found
the child with Mary his mother,”<a id="FNanchor_429" href="#Footnote_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a> says: Jesus is
never found but with and through Mary;<a id="FNanchor_430" href="#Footnote_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a> and concludes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
with these words: He seeks Jesus in vain who
does not look for him with Mary.<a id="FNanchor_431" href="#Footnote_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a> Hence St. Ildephonsus
says: I would be a servant of the Son, and
as he can never be a servant of the Son who is not the
servant of the mother, my ambition is to be
a servant of Mary.<a id="FNanchor_432" href="#Footnote_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a></p>

<h5>EXAMPLE.</h5>

<p>It is related by Belluacensis<a id="FNanchor_433" href="#Footnote_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a> and Cesarius,<a id="FNanchor_434" href="#Footnote_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a> that
a noble youth having lost by his vices the wealth left
him by his father, became so poor that he was obliged
to beg. He quitted his native land, that he might live
with less shame in a distant country where he was
unknown. On this journey he met one day an old
servant of his father, who, seeing him so cast down by
the poverty he was suffering, told him to cheer up,
for he would take him to a prince who was so liberal
that he would provide him with every thing he needed.
Now this wretch was an impious sorcerer. One day
he took the youth with him to a wood on the borders
of a moor, where he began to address some invisible
person. The youth asked to whom he was speaking.
“To the devil,” he answered; and seeing the youth
terrified, bade him not to fear. Continuing to speak<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
with the devil, he said: “This youth, oh my master,
is reduced to extreme necessity, and wishes to be restored
to his former condition.” “If he will obey
me,” said the enemy, “I will make him richer than
before; but in the first place, he must renounce God.”
At this the youth shuddered, but urged on by that
cursed magician, he yielded, and renounced God.
“But this is not sufficient,” said the demon; “he
must also renounce Mary; for it is to her that we attribute
our greatest losses. Oh, how many souls she has
snatched from us, and led back to God and saved!”
“Oh, this I will not do,” exclaimed the youth; “deny
Mary! why she is my only hope. I would rather be
a beggar all my life.” With these words he left the
place. On his way he happened to pass a church
dedicated to Mary. The unhappy youth entered it,
and kneeling before her altar, began to weep and implore
the most holy Virgin that she would obtain the
pardon of his sins. Mary immediately began to intercede
with the Son for that miserable being. Jesus at
first said: “But that ungrateful youth, my mother,
has denied me.” But seeing that his mother still
continued to entreat him, he at last said: “Oh, my
mother, I have never refused thee any thing; he shall
be pardoned, since thou dost ask it.” The citizen who
had purchased the inheritance of that prodigal was
secretly present at this scene, and beholding the mercy
of Mary towards that sinner, he gave him his only
daughter in marriage, and made him heir of all his
possessions. Thus that youth recovered, through the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
intercession of Mary, the favor of God and even his
temporal possessions.</p>

<h5>PRAYER.</h5>

<p>Oh my soul! behold the beautiful hope of salvation,
and of life eternal, which the Lord has granted
thee, by giving thee, in his mercy, confidence in the
protection of his mother, when thou hast by thy sins
so often merited his displeasure and the pains of hell.
Give thanks, then, to God, and to thy protectress,
Mary, who hath deigned to shelter thee beneath her
mantle, as already thou certainly knowest, by the
many graces that thou hast received through her.
Yes, I thank thee, oh my loving mother! for the
good thou hast done me, a miserable sinner, deserving
of hell. From how many dangers hast thou delivered
me, oh my queen! How much light and how many
mercies hast thou obtained for me, from God, by thy
intercession! What great advantage, or what great
honor hast thou received from me, that thou art thus
intent on doing me good?</p>

<p>Thy goodness alone, then, hath moved thee in my
behalf. Ah! if I were to give my blood, my life for
thee, it would be little compared to what I owe thee,
for thou hast delivered me from eternal death; thou,
who hast enabled me to recover, as I hope, the divine
favor, and from thee finally I acknowledge all my
blessings to proceed. Oh my Lady! most worthy of
love, I a miserable creature can make thee no return
but always to praise and love thee. Ah! do not disdain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
to accept the affection of a poor sinner, who is
enamored of thy goodness. If my heart is not worthy
to love thee, because it is evil and full of earthly affections,
do thou change it. Ah! unite me to my God,
and unite me so that I can never be separated from
his love. This thou desirest of me, that I may love
thy God, and this I wish from thee. Obtain for me
that I may love him, and love him always, and I ask
nothing more. Amen.</p>

<h4 id="CHAPTER_V_SECTION_II">SECTION II.<br>
THE SAME SUBJECT CONTINUED.</h4>

<p>St. Bernard says, that as a man and a woman have
co-operated for our ruin, so it was fit that another man
and another woman should co-operate for our restoration;
and these were Jesus and his mother Mary.
Doubtless, says the saint, Jesus Christ alone was all-sufficient
for our redemption: yet it was more fitting
that each sex should take part in our redemption, when
both took part in our corruption.<a id="FNanchor_435" href="#Footnote_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a> For this reason
blessed Albertus Magnus calls Mary the co-operatrix
with Christ in our redemption: “Adjutrix Redemptionis.”
And she herself revealed to St. Bridget, that
as Adam and Eve sold the world for one apple, so her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
Son and herself with one heart redeemed the world.<a id="FNanchor_436" href="#Footnote_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a>
God could, indeed, as St. Anselm asserts, create the
world from nothing; but when it was lost by sin, he
would not redeem it without the co-operation of
Mary.<a id="FNanchor_437" href="#Footnote_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a></p>

<p>In three ways, says Father Suarez, the divine mother
shared in the work of our salvation: first, by having
merited, that is, with merit of congruity, the Incarnation
of the Word. Secondly, by praying much for
us while she lived on the earth. Thirdly, by willingly
sacrificing to God the life of her Son for our salvation;
and therefore the Lord has justly ordained that as
Mary has, with so much love for man, aided in the salvation
of all, and thereby so greatly promoted the
glory of God, all through her intercession shall obtain
salvation.</p>

<p>Mary is called the co-operatrix with her Son in our
justification, because God has committed to her keeping
all the graces that he has destined for us.<a id="FNanchor_438" href="#Footnote_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a> Wherefore
St. Bernard affirms, that all men, past, present,
and to come, should regard her as the medium and
negotiator of the salvation of all ages.<a id="FNanchor_439" href="#Footnote_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span></p>

<p>Jesus Christ has said, that no one could find him
unless his Eternal Father drew him by his divine
grace.<a id="FNanchor_440" href="#Footnote_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a> Thus, also, according to Richard, Jesus said
of his mother: No one comes to me unless my mother
draw him with her prayers.<a id="FNanchor_441" href="#Footnote_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a></p>

<p>Jesus was the fruit of Mary, as Elizabeth expressed
it: “Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is
the fruit of thy womb.”<a id="FNanchor_442" href="#Footnote_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a> Whoever, then, wishes for
the fruit, must go to the tree; whoever wishes for
Jesus must go to Mary; and he who finds Mary, certainly
also finds Jesus. St. Elizabeth, when the most
holy Virgin came to visit her in her house, not knowing
how to thank her, in deep humility exclaimed: “How
have I merited that the mother of my God should
come to visit me?”<a id="FNanchor_443" href="#Footnote_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a> But why! we may ask: did
not Elizabeth already know that not Mary only, but
Jesus also, had entered her dwelling? And why, then,
does she call herself unworthy to receive the mother,
and not rather unworthy of receiving a visit from the
Son? Ah, well did the saint understand that when
Mary comes she brings Jesus also; and hence it was
sufficient for her to thank the mother, without naming
the Son.</p>

<p>“She is like the merchant’s ship, she bringeth her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
bread from afar.”<a id="FNanchor_444" href="#Footnote_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a> Mary is that blessed ship, which
brought to us from heaven Jesus Christ, the living
bread that came from heaven to give us life eternal,
as he has said: “I am the living bread which came
down from heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he
shall live forever.”<a id="FNanchor_445" href="#Footnote_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a> Hence Richard of St. Laurence
says, that all those will be lost in the sea of this world
who are not received into this ship, that is, protected
by Mary.<a id="FNanchor_446" href="#Footnote_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a> He also adds, that whenever we find ourselves
in danger of destruction from the temptations
or passions of the present life, we ought to flee to
Mary, crying quickly, Oh Lady, help us; save us, if
thou wouldst not see us lost.<a id="FNanchor_447" href="#Footnote_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a> And let it be remarked
here, in passing, that this writer does not hesitate
to say to Mary: Save us, we perish—“Salva nos,
perimus;” as the author mentioned several times in
the previous section does, who denies that we can ask
the Virgin to save us, because, as he says, it belongs
only to God to save us. But if a person condemned
to death may ask some favorite of the king to save
him by interceding for him with his prince, why cannot
we implore the mother of God to save us, by obtaining
for us through her prayers the grace of eternal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
life? St. John of Damascus did not hesitate to say
to the Virgin: Oh pure and immaculate queen, save
me, deliver me from eternal damnation.<a id="FNanchor_448" href="#Footnote_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a> St. Bonaventure
called Mary the salvation of those invoking
her.<a id="FNanchor_449" href="#Footnote_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a> The Church allows us to invoke her: Health of
the weak—“Salus infirmorum;” and shall we hesitate
to ask her to save us, when, according to a certain
author, to no one is the door of salvation open except
through her?<a id="FNanchor_450" href="#Footnote_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a> And before him St. Germanus, speaking
of Mary, said: No one can be saved except
through thee.<a id="FNanchor_451" href="#Footnote_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a></p>

<p>But let us see what more the saints say of the need
we have of the intercession of the divine mother. The
glorious St. Cajetan said that we could ask for graces,
but we could never obtain them without the intercession
of Mary. And St. Antoninus confirms this, expressing
himself thus beautifully: Whoever asks and
wishes to obtain graces without the intercession of
Mary, attempts to fly without wings;<a id="FNanchor_452" href="#Footnote_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a> for, as Pharaoh
said to Joseph, “The land of Egypt is in thy hand;”<a id="FNanchor_453" href="#Footnote_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a>
and as he sent all those to Joseph who applied to
him for assistance, saying: Go to Joseph—“Ite ad<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
Joseph;” so God, when we supplicate him for favors,
sends us to Mary: Go to Mary—“Ite ad Mariam;”
for he has decreed, says St. Bernard, that he will
grant no favors except through the hands of Mary.<a id="FNanchor_454" href="#Footnote_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a>
Hence Richard of St. Laurence says: Our salvation
is in the hands of Mary, and we Christians can more
justly say to her than the Egyptians to Joseph, our
salvation is in thy hand.<a id="FNanchor_455" href="#Footnote_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a> The venerable Idiot says
the same thing: Our salvation is in her hands—“Salus
nostra in manu illius est.”<a id="FNanchor_456" href="#Footnote_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a> Cassian asserts the same
thing, but in stronger language. He absolutely affirms
that the salvation of the whole world depends
upon the favor and protection of Mary.<a id="FNanchor_457" href="#Footnote_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a> St. Bernardine
of Sienna thus addresses her: Oh Lady,
since thou art the dispenser of all graces, and we must
receive the grace of salvation through thy hand alone,
then our salvation depends on thee.<a id="FNanchor_458" href="#Footnote_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a></p>

<p>Richard says rightly then, that as a stone falls
so soon as the earth is removed from beneath it, in
like manner a soul, if the support of Mary is taken
away, will fall first into sin and then into hell.<a id="FNanchor_459" href="#Footnote_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a> St.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
Bonaventure adds, that God will not save us without
the intercession of Mary,<a id="FNanchor_460" href="#Footnote_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a> and goes on to say, that as
an infant cannot live without its nurse, so no one without
the protection of Mary can be saved.<a id="FNanchor_461" href="#Footnote_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a> Therefore
he exhorts us in this way: Let thy soul thirst for
devotion to Mary; preserve it always, never abandon
it until you arrive in heaven and receive her maternal
benediction.<a id="FNanchor_462" href="#Footnote_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a> Who, says St. Germanus, would ever
know God, if it were not through thee, oh most
holy Mary? Who would be saved? Who would
be free from peril? Who would receive any favor if
it were not through thee, oh mother of God? Oh
Virgin mother, oh full of grace!<a id="FNanchor_463" href="#Footnote_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a> And in another
place he says: If thou didst not open the way, no
one would be free from the sting of the flesh and of
sin.<a id="FNanchor_464" href="#Footnote_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a></p>

<p>As we have access to the eternal Father only
through Jesus Christ, so, says St. Bernard, we have
access to Jesus Christ only through Mary.<a id="FNanchor_465" href="#Footnote_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a> And St.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
Bernard gives us the reason why the Lord decreed
that all men should be saved by the intercession of
Mary, namely, that through Mary we might be received
by that Saviour who, through Mary, has been
given to us; and therefore the saint calls her the
mother of grace and of our salvation. Then, resumes
St. Germanus, what would become of us? what hope
of salvation would remain to us if thou, oh Mary,
didst abandon us, thou who art the life of Christians?<a id="FNanchor_466" href="#Footnote_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a></p>

<p>But, the modern author above quoted remarks: If
all graces pass through Mary, when we implore the
intercession of the saints, they must have recourse to
the mediation of Mary to obtain for us these graces.
This, however, says he, no one believes, or has ever
thought of. I reply, that there can be no error or
difficulty in believing this. What difficulty is there in
saying that God, to honor his mother, having crowned
her queen of the saints, and having ordained that all
graces should be dispensed by her hands, would have
the saints also invoke her to obtain favors for their
clients? As to saying that no one has ever thought
of it, I find that St. Bernard, St. Anselm, St. Bonaventure,
Father Suarez<a id="FNanchor_467" href="#Footnote_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a> also, and others expressly assert it.
In vain, says St. Bernard, would one pray to the other
saints for a desired favor, if Mary did not intercede to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
obtain it for them.<a id="FNanchor_468" href="#Footnote_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a> Thus also a certain author explains,
in this connection, that passage of David: “All
the rich among the people shall entreat thy countenance.”<a id="FNanchor_469" href="#Footnote_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a>
The rich of that great people of God are
the saints, who, when they wish to obtain a favor for
one of their clients, all recommend themselves to
Mary, that she may obtain it for them. Justly, then,
says Father Suarez, we implore the saints to be our
intercessors with Mary, who is their lady and queen.<a id="FNanchor_470" href="#Footnote_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a></p>

<p>It is precisely this which St. Benedict promised to
St. Frances of Rome, as we learn from Father Marchese.<a id="FNanchor_471" href="#Footnote_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a>
The above-named saint appeared to her one
day, and taking her under his protection, promised to
be her advocate with the divine mother. St. Anselm
adds, in confirmation of this, addressing the blessed
Virgin: Oh Lady, what the prayers of all these saints
can obtain, in union with thine, thou canst obtain, by
thy intercession alone without their aid.<a id="FNanchor_472" href="#Footnote_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a> But wherefore
hast thou such power? “quare hoc potes?” continues
the saint. Because thou alone art the mother
of our common Saviour, thou art the spouse of God,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
the universal queen of heaven and earth.<a id="FNanchor_473" href="#Footnote_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a> If thou
dost not speak for us, no saint will pray for us and
aid us.<a id="FNanchor_474" href="#Footnote_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a> But if thou art moved to pray for us, all
the saints will engage to intercede for us and help us.<a id="FNanchor_475" href="#Footnote_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a>
So says Father Segneri,<a id="FNanchor_476" href="#Footnote_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a> applying to Mary, as the
holy Church does, these words of Wisdom: “I alone
have compassed the circuit of heaven.”<a id="FNanchor_477" href="#Footnote_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a> As with its
motion the first sphere puts in motion all the others,
so when Mary is moved to pray for a soul, she moves
all heaven to pray with her. St. Bonaventure says
even, that then she commands, as being their queen,
all the saints and angels to accompany her and unite
their prayers to hers.<a id="FNanchor_478" href="#Footnote_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a></p>

<p>So we see, finally, why the holy Church requires
us to invoke and salute the divine mother with the
great name of our hope: Hail our hope, “Spes nostra
salve.” The impious Luther could not endure that
the holy Roman Church should call Mary, our
hope;<a id="FNanchor_479" href="#Footnote_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a> because, as he said, God only and Jesus<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
Christ as our mediator are our hope; but that God
curses those who place their hope in any creature, as
we find in Jeremias: “Cursed be the man that trusteth
in man.”<a id="FNanchor_480" href="#Footnote_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a> But the Church teaches us everywhere
to invoke Mary, and call her our hope: “Spes nostra
salve.” Whoever places his hope in a creature, independently
of God, is certainly accursed of God, since
God is the only fountain and the dispenser of every
good, and the creature, without God, has nothing and
can do nothing. But if the Lord has ordained, as we
have proved, that all graces shall pass through Mary,
as a channel of mercy, we can, and ought even to assert
that Mary is our hope, by whose intercession we receive
divine graces, and therefore it is St. Bernard called
her the whole cause of his hope.<a id="FNanchor_481" href="#Footnote_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a> St. John of Damascus
expresses the same thing when, addressing the
blessed Virgin, he says to her: Oh Lady, in thee I
have placed all my hope, and with firm confidence
I look to thee for my salvation.<a id="FNanchor_482" href="#Footnote_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a> St. Thomas says
that Mary is all the hope of our salvation.<a id="FNanchor_483" href="#Footnote_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a> St.
Ephrem explains: Oh most holy Virgin, receive us
under thy protection, if thou wilt see us saved, since we
have no other hope of being saved but through thee.<a id="FNanchor_484" href="#Footnote_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span></p>

<p>We will then conclude in the words of St. Bernard:
Let us strive, with all the affections of our heart, to
reverence this divine mother, Mary, since this is the
will of that Lord who would have us receive all good
from her hands.<a id="FNanchor_485" href="#Footnote_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a> And the saint exhorts us, whenever
we desire and ask any favor, to recommend ourselves
to Mary, and trust that we shall obtain it through her
intercession.<a id="FNanchor_486" href="#Footnote_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a> For, says the saint, if you do not deserve
from God the favor you ask, Mary, who asks it
in your behalf, merits to obtain it.<a id="FNanchor_487" href="#Footnote_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a> Hence the same
Bernard exhorts us each and all, that, whatever we offer
to God, whether works or prayers, we recommend all
to Mary, if we wish our Lord to accept them.<a id="FNanchor_488" href="#Footnote_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a></p>

<h5>EXAMPLE.</h5>

<p>Eutychian, Patriarch of Constantinople, relates the
following well-known story of Theophilus. The Patriarch
was an eye-witness of the fact which we here
relate, and which is confirmed by St. Peter Damian,
St. Bernard, St. Bonaventure, St. Antoninus, and
others.<a id="FNanchor_489" href="#Footnote_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a> Theophilus was archdeacon of the Church<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
of Adanas, a city of Cilicia; and was so much esteemed,
that the people wished him to become their
bishop, but his humility prevented his consent. Some
malicious persons afterwards accused him, and he
was deposed from his office. This afflicted him so
much, that, blinded by passion, he went to a Jewish
magician, who induced him to apply to Satan for help
in his misfortunes. The devil answered that if he
wished his assistance, he must renounce Jesus, and
Mary his mother, and hand over to him the act of renunciation,
written with his own hand. Theophilus
executed this vile document. On the following day
the bishop having heard of the wrong done him by his
calumniators, asked his forgiveness, and restored him
to his office. But Theophilus began then to feel so
tortured by remorse of conscience on account of the
great crime he had committed, that he wept continually.
What does he do? He enters a church,
prostrates himself in tears before an altar of the
blessed Virgin, and exclaims: “Oh mother of God,
I will not despair having thee, who art so merciful, to
aid me.” He persevered forty days in weeping and
praying thus to the holy Virgin; when behold, one
night the mother of mercy appeared to him and said:
“Oh Theophilus, what have you done? you have renounced
my friendship and that of my Son; and for
whom? for your own and my enemy.” “Oh Lady,”
answered Theophilus, “it belongs to thee to pardon
me, and to obtain my pardon from thy Son.” Then
Mary, seeing his confidence, answered, “Take courage,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
and I will pray God for thee.” Theophilus, encouraged
by these words, redoubled his tears, his penance, and
his prayers, remaining constantly at the foot of that
altar. And, behold, Mary appeared to him again, and
with a joyful countenance said to him: “Theophilus,
rejoice, I have presented thy tears and thy prayers
to God; he hath accepted them, and hath already
pardoned thee; henceforth be grateful and faithful.”
“Oh Lady,” replied Theophilus, “this is not sufficient
to console me; the enemy still holds that impious
deed, by which I have renounced thee and thy Son;
thou canst obtain it for me.” After three days Theophilus
awoke one night, and found the paper on his
breast. The next day, when the bishop with a large
assembly were present in the church, Theophilus cast
himself at his feet, related the whole story, weeping
bitterly, and gave him the infamous writing, which
the bishop immediately ordered to be burned in presence
of all the people, who wept for joy, praising the
goodness of God, and the mercy of Mary towards that
miserable sinner. Theophilus returned to the church
of the Virgin, and there, three days afterwards, he
died happily, with thanksgivings to Jesus and his
holy mother on his lips.</p>

<h5>PRAYER.</h5>

<p>Oh Queen and Mother of Mercy! who dost dispense
graces to all those who have recourse to thee, so liberally
because thou art queen, and with so much love
because thou art our most loving mother; to thee I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
commend myself to-day, destitute of merits and virtues
as I am, and laden with debts to the divine justice.
Oh Mary, thou hast the keys of all the divine mercies,
do not forget my miseries, and do not leave me in my
great poverty. Thou who art so liberal with all, and
who givest more than is asked of thee, do so with me.
Oh Lady, protect me, this is all I ask. If thou dost
protect me I fear nothing. I do not fear the demons,
for thou art more powerful than all the spirits of hell;
nor my sins, for one word of thine in my behalf can
obtain pardon of them all from God. If I have thy
favor I do not fear even the anger of God, for he is
appeased by one prayer of thine. In a word, if thou
dost protect me I hope all things, because all things
are possible with thee. Oh mother of mercy, I know
that thou takest pleasure and pride in giving succor
to the most miserable, for thou canst aid them, if not
prevented by their obstinacy. I am a sinner, but I
am not obstinate; I wish to change my life. Thou
canst, then, help me; do help and save me. To-day
I place myself entirely in thy hands. Teach me what
I must do to please God, and I will do it; and I hope
to do so with thy aid, oh Mary, Mary, my mother,
my light, my consolation, my refuge, and my hope.
Amen, amen, amen.</p>

<p class="center">Ah, then, our advocate!</p>

</div>

<h4 id="CHAPTER_VI_SECTION_I">SECTION I.<br>
MARY IS AN ADVOCATE POWERFUL TO SAVE ALL.</h4>

<p>So great is the authority of mothers over their
children, that although they may be monarchs, having
absolute dominion over all the persons in their kingdom,
yet their mothers can never become subject to
them. It is true that Jesus is now in heaven, for he
is seated there at the right hand of the Father even
as man, as St. Thomas explains it; by reason of the
hypostatic union with the person of the Word, and
has supreme dominion over all, and even over Mary;
yet it will always be true, that at the time when our
Redeemer lived on this earth, he was pleased to humble
himself and make himself subject to Mary, as St.
Luke teaches us: And he was subject to them: “Erat
subditus illis.”<a id="FNanchor_490" href="#Footnote_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a> St. Ambrose even says, that Jesus
Christ having deigned to make Mary his mother, was
obliged as her son to obey her. And therefore, observes
Richard of St. Laurence, it is said of the other<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span>
saints, that they are with God; but of Mary alone can
it be said, that not only was it her lot to be subject to
the will of God, but that God was also subject to her
will.<a id="FNanchor_491" href="#Footnote_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a> And as it is said of the other holy virgins, as
the same author remarks, that they follow the divine
Lamb wherever he goes: “Sequuntur agnum quocumque
ierit;”<a id="FNanchor_492" href="#Footnote_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a> of the Virgin Mary it may be said,
that the divine Lamb followed her on this earth, having
become subject to her.<a id="FNanchor_493" href="#Footnote_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a></p>

<p>Hence we may say, that though Mary is in heaven,
and can no longer command her Son, yet her prayers
will ever be the prayers of a mother, and therefore
most powerful to obtain whatever she asks. Mary,
says St. Bonaventure, has this privilege with her Son,
that she is most powerful to obtain by her prayers
whatsoever she will.<a id="FNanchor_494" href="#Footnote_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a> And wherefore? Precisely
for the reason which we have before mentioned, and
which we will now examine more fully, namely, because
the prayers of Mary are the prayers of a mother.
And therefore, says St. Peter Damian, the Virgin has
all power in heaven as on earth, being able to raise to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span>
the hope of salvation even the most despairing.<a id="FNanchor_495" href="#Footnote_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a> And
then he adds, that when the mother asks any favor
for us of Jesus Christ (called by the saint the altar of
mercy where sinners obtain pardon from God), the
Son has so great regard for the prayers of Mary, and
so great a desire to please her, that when she prays,
she seems to command rather than request, and to be
a mistress rather than a handmaid.<a id="FNanchor_496" href="#Footnote_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a> Thus Jesus
would honor this his dear mother, who has honored
him so much in her life, by granting her immediately
whatever she asks and desires. St. Germanus beautifully
confirms this by saying to the Virgin: Thou
art mother of God, omnipotent to save sinners, and
needest no other recommendation with God, since
thou art the mother of true life.<a id="FNanchor_497" href="#Footnote_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a></p>

<p>St. Bernardine of Sienna does not hesitate to say
that all obey the commands of Mary, even God himself;<a id="FNanchor_498" href="#Footnote_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a>
signifying by these words, that God listens to
her prayers as though they were commands. Hence
St. Anselm thus addresses Mary: The Lord, oh holy
Virgin, has so highly exalted thee, that by his favor
thou canst obtain all possible graces for thy servants,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span>
for thy protection is omnipotent.<a id="FNanchor_499" href="#Footnote_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a> Thy help is omnipotent,
oh Mary: “Omnipotens auxilium tuum, O
Maria;” as Cosmas of Jerusalem exclaims. Yes,
Mary is omnipotent, adds Richard of St. Laurence,
since the queen, by every law, must enjoy the same
privileges as the king. For as the power of the Son
and mother are the same, the mother by the omnipotent
Son is made omnipotent.<a id="FNanchor_500" href="#Footnote_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a> As St. Antoninus says:
God has placed the whole Church, not only under the
patronage, but also under the dominion of Mary.<a id="FNanchor_501" href="#Footnote_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a></p>

<p>As the mother, then, must have the same power as
the Son, justly was Mary made omnipotent by Jesus,
who is omnipotent; it being, however, always true,
that whereas the Son is omnipotent by nature, the
mother is so by grace. And her omnipotence consists
in this, that the Son denies nothing that the mother
asks; as it was revealed to St. Bridget, who heard
Jesus one day addressing Mary in these words: “Oh
my mother, thou knowest how I love thee; ask from
me, then, whatever thou dost desire, for there is no
demand of thine that will not be graciously heard by
me.”<a id="FNanchor_502" href="#Footnote_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a> And the reason that he added was beautiful:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
“Mother, when thou wast on earth, there was nothing
thou didst refuse to do for love of me; now
that I am in heaven, it is just that I refuse nothing
which thou dost ask of me.”<a id="FNanchor_503" href="#Footnote_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a> Mary is, then, called
omnipotent in the sense in which it can be understood
of a creature, who is not capable of any divine attribute.
She is omnipotent, because she obtains by
her prayers whatever she wishes.</p>

<p>With reason, then, oh our great advocate! says St.
Bernard, dost thou only wish, and it is done: “Velis
tu et omnia fient.” And St. Anselm: Whatever thou
askest, oh Virgin! cannot but be done.<a id="FNanchor_504" href="#Footnote_504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a> Wish, and
it will be done; dost thou wish to raise the most abandoned
sinner to an exalted sanctity, to thee it is given
to do it. The blessed Albertus Magnus represents
Mary speaking thus: I must be asked to wish, for if
I wish it must be done.<a id="FNanchor_505" href="#Footnote_505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a> Hence St. Peter Damian,
contemplating this great power of Mary, and praying
her to have pity on us, says: Oh Mary! oh our beloved
advocate! since thou hast a heart so compassionate,
that thou canst not behold the miserable without
pity; and, at the same time, hast so great a
power with God to save all those whom thou dost defend;
deign to intercede in behalf of us miserable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
creatures, who place in thee all our hopes. If our
prayers do not move thee, may thy merciful heart at
least move thee; may thy power at least move thee,
since God, for this end, has enriched thee with so much
power, that the richer thou art in the power to aid us,
so much more compassionate thou mayest be in thy
desire to aid us.<a id="FNanchor_506" href="#Footnote_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a> Of this, St. Bernard assures us,
saying, that Mary is abundant in mercy as well as in
power; as her charity is most powerful, so also is it
most merciful in our behalf, and this is manifested to
us continually by its effects.<a id="FNanchor_507" href="#Footnote_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a></p>

<p>Even when she was living on this earth, the only
thought of Mary, after the glory of God, was to
relieve the wretched. And we know that then she
enjoyed already the privilege of obtaining whatever
she asked. This we know from what took place at
the nuptials of Cana of Galilee, when the wine failed,
and the blessed Virgin, compassionating the distress
and mortification of that family, asked the Son to
relieve them by a miracle, making known to him this
want: They have no wine: “Vinum non habent.”<a id="FNanchor_508" href="#Footnote_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a>
Jesus answered: “Woman, what is that to thee and
to me? my hour is not yet come.”<a id="FNanchor_509" href="#Footnote_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a> Observe, that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
although the Lord appeared to refuse this favor to his
mother, by saying: Of what importance is it, oh woman,
to me and to thee that the wine has failed? It does
not become me now to perform any miracle, as the
time has not arrived, the time of my preaching, when
with signs I must confirm my doctrine; yet, notwithstanding
this, Mary, as if the Son had already granted
her the favor, said to the attendants: Fill the water-pots
with water: “Imple hydrias aqua.”<a id="FNanchor_510" href="#Footnote_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a> Come fill
the water-pots, and you will be consoled; and Jesus
Christ, indeed, to please his mother, changed that
water into the best wine. But how is this? If the
time appointed for miracles was the time of preaching,
how could it be anticipated by the miracle of the
wine, contrary to the divine decree? Nothing, it may
be answered, was done contrary to the divine decrees;
for although, generally speaking, the time for signs
had not come, yet from eternity God had established
by another general decree, that nothing the divine
mother could ask should be denied her; and therefore
Mary, well acquainted with her privilege, although
her Son seemed to have then set aside her petition,
said notwithstanding, that the water-pots should be
filled, as though the favor were already granted.
This, St. John Chrysostom would express, when commenting
on the passage of John above mentioned—“Oh
woman, what is that to thee and to me?”—he
says, that although Jesus had answered thus, yet, for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span>
the honor of his mother, he did not fail to comply
with her demand.<a id="FNanchor_511" href="#Footnote_511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a> St. Thomas confirms the same,
when he observes, that by these words—“My hour
has not yet come”—Jesus Christ wished to show that
he would have deferred the miracle, if another had
asked him to perform it; but because his mother asked
it, he immediately performed it.<a id="FNanchor_512" href="#Footnote_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a> St. Cyril and St.
Jerome confirm this, according to Barrada. And
Jansenius of Ghent says, commenting on the same
passage of St. John: That he might honor his mother,
he anticipated the time of working miracles.<a id="FNanchor_513" href="#Footnote_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a></p>

<p>In a word, it is certain that no creature can obtain
for us miserable sinners so many mercies as this good
advocate, who is honored by God with this privilege,
not only as his beloved handmaid, but also as his true
mother. William of Paris says this when addressing
her.<a id="FNanchor_514" href="#Footnote_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a> It is enough that Mary speaks, and the Son
does all she wishes. The Lord, speaking to the spouse
of the Canticles, by whom is understood Mary, says:
“Thou that dwellest in the gardens, the friends<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
hearken, make me hear thy voice.”<a id="FNanchor_515" href="#Footnote_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a> The friends are
the saints, who, when they ask any favor for their
clients, wait until their queen prays to God for it and
obtains it; for, as was said before in Chap. V., no
favor is dispensed except by the intercession of Mary.
And how does Mary obtain favors? It is enough
that her Son hears her voice: Make me to hear thy
voice: “Fac me audire vocem tuam.” It is enough
that she speaks, and her Son immediately hears her.
William of Paris, explaining in the same way the
passage above named, introduces the Son, who thus
addresses Mary: Oh thou who dwellest in the celestial
gardens, intercede with confidence for whomsoever
thou wilt, for I cannot forget that I am thy Son, or
think of refusing any thing to my mother. It is enough
for thee to speak, and thy Son will graciously hear
and grant thy petition.<a id="FNanchor_516" href="#Footnote_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a> The Abbot Godfrey says
that Mary, although she obtains favors by praying,
yet prays with a kind of maternal authority; hence
we may be sure that she will obtain whatever she
desires and asks for us.<a id="FNanchor_517" href="#Footnote_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a></p>

<p>It is related of Coriolanus, by Valerius<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>
Maximus,<a id="FNanchor_518" href="#Footnote_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a> that when he held Rome besieged, all the prayers
of his friends and of the citizens could not induce him
to withdraw his forces; but when his mother Veturia
came to entreat him he could not resist, and immediately
raised the siege. But the prayers of Mary are
as much more powerful with Jesus than the prayers
of Veturia with her son, as the love and gratitude of
Jesus to Mary exceeds that of the son of Veturia for
his mother. Father Justin Micoviensis writes: One
sigh of Mary has more power than the prayers of all
the saints united.<a id="FNanchor_519" href="#Footnote_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a> The devil himself confessed this
same thing to St. Dominic, when, constrained by his
commands, he spoke through the mouth of a possessed
person, saying, as Father Paciucchelli narrates,<a id="FNanchor_520" href="#Footnote_520" class="fnanchor">[520]</a> that
one sigh of Mary availed more with God than the
united prayers of all the saints.</p>

<p>St. Antoninus says, that the prayers of the blessed
Virgin being the prayers of a mother, have a certain
kind of authority, hence it is impossible that she
should not be heard when she prays.<a id="FNanchor_521" href="#Footnote_521" class="fnanchor">[521]</a> On this account
St. Germanus encourages sinners to recommend
themselves to this advocate with these words: Thou,
oh Mary, having the authority of a mother with God,
dost obtain pardon for the vilest sinners; for the Lord,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
who in all things recognizes thee for his true mother,
cannot refuse to grant thee whatever thou dost ask.<a id="FNanchor_522" href="#Footnote_522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a>
St. Bridget, too, heard the saints in heaven saying to
the Virgin: What is there that thou canst not do?
Whatever thou dost desire is done.<a id="FNanchor_523" href="#Footnote_523" class="fnanchor">[523]</a> To which corresponds
that celebrated verse: What God by a command,
thou, oh Virgin, by a prayer canst effect.<a id="FNanchor_524" href="#Footnote_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a> Is
it not, says St. Augustine, worthy of the goodness
of the Lord thus to guard the honor of his mother?
for he asserts that he has come on the earth, not to
break, but to fulfil the law, which, among other things,
commands us to honor our parents.<a id="FNanchor_525" href="#Footnote_525" class="fnanchor">[525]</a></p>

<p>St. George, Archbishop of Nicomedia, even adds,
that Jesus Christ grants to his mother all her petitions,
as if to satisfy the obligation that he is under to her
for having caused, by her consent, that the human
nature should be given him.<a id="FNanchor_526" href="#Footnote_526" class="fnanchor">[526]</a> Wherefore, St. Methodius
the martyr exclaims: Rejoice, oh Mary, that a
Son has fallen to thy lot as thy debtor, who gives to
all and receives from none. We are all debtors to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
God for whatever we possess, since every thing is his
gift; but God has wished to make himself a debtor to
thee, taking from thee his body and becoming man.<a id="FNanchor_527" href="#Footnote_527" class="fnanchor">[527]</a>
So also St. Augustine says: Mary having merited to
give flesh to the Divine Word, and by that to furnish
the price of the divine redemption, that we might be
delivered from eternal death; therefore is she, says
the same doctor, more powerful than any other to
help us and obtain for us eternal salvation.<a id="FNanchor_528" href="#Footnote_528" class="fnanchor">[528]</a> Hence
St. Theophilus, Bishop of Alexandria, who lived in the
time of St. Jerome, thus wrote: The Son is pleased to
be entreated by his mother, because he wishes to grant
for her sake all that he does grant; and thus to
recompense the favor he has received from her when
she gave him flesh. Hence St. John Damascene addresses
the Virgin in these words: Thou, then, oh
Mary, being mother of God, canst save all men by
thy prayers, which are enforced by a mother’s authority.<a id="FNanchor_529" href="#Footnote_529" class="fnanchor">[529]</a></p>

<p>Let us conclude with the words of St. Bonaventure,
who, considering the great benefit which the Lord has
conferred on us in giving us Mary for our advocate,
thus addresses her: Oh truly immense and admirable
goodness of God, who to us miserable, guilty creatures,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span>
has granted thee, oh our Lady, for our advocate,
that thou mightest, by thy powerful intercession, obtain
for us whatever good thou wilt.<a id="FNanchor_530" href="#Footnote_530" class="fnanchor">[530]</a> Oh, the great
mercy of God, continues the saint, who, that we
might not flee to hide ourselves from the sentence to
be pronounced upon us, has destined his own mother
and the treasurer of graces for our advocate.<a id="FNanchor_531" href="#Footnote_531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a></p>

<h5>EXAMPLE.</h5>

<p>Father Razzi, of the order of Camaldoli, relates
that a certain youth having lost his father, was sent
by his mother to the court of a prince.<a id="FNanchor_532" href="#Footnote_532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a> The mother,
who had a great devotion to Mary, when she parted
with him made him promise to recite every day a
“Hail Mary,” and add these words: “<i>Blessed Virgin,
help me in the hour of my death</i>.” The youth arrived
at court, but soon began to lead so dissolute a life,
that his master was obliged to send him away. In
despair, without means of support, he went into the
country and became a highway robber; but even then
he did not omit to recommend himself to our Lady,
as his mother had directed him. At length he fell
into the hands of justice, and was condemned to death.
Being in prison the evening before his execution,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span>
and thinking of his disgrace, the grief of his mother,
and the death which awaited him, he fell to weeping
bitterly. The devil seeing him so oppressed by melancholy,
appeared to him in the form of a beautiful
young man, and said to him that he would release
him from death and prison, if he would follow his
directions. The convict engaged to do all that he
required. Then the pretended youth made known to
him that he was the devil and had come to his assistance.
In the first place, he ordered him to renounce
Jesus Christ and the holy sacraments. The youth
consented. He then required him to renounce the
Virgin Mary and her protection. “This,” exclaimed
the young man, “I will never do,” and turning to
Mary, repeated the accustomed prayer that his mother
had taught him: <i>Blessed Virgin, help me in the hour
of my death</i>. At these words the devil disappeared.
The youth remained in great affliction for the wickedness
he had committed in denying Jesus Christ. He
invoked the blessed Virgin, and she obtained for him,
by her prayers, a great sorrow for all his sins, so that
he made his confession with much weeping and contrition.
On his way to the gallows, happening to pass
before a statue of Mary, he saluted her with his usual
prayer: <i>Blessed Virgin, help me in the hour of my
death</i>, and the statue, in the presence of all, inclined
its head and saluted him. Deeply moved, he begged
to be allowed to kiss the feet of the image. The executioners
refused, but afterwards consented on account
of the clamor of the people. The youth stooped to kiss<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
her feet, and Mary extended her arm from that statue,
took him by the hand and held him so strongly that
no power could move him. At this prodigy the multitude
shouted “Pardon, pardon,” and pardon was
granted. Having returned to his country, he led an
exemplary life, and was always most devoted to
Mary, who had delivered him from temporal and
eternal death.</p>

<h5>PRAYER.</h5>

<p>Oh great mother of God, I will say to thee with St.
Bernard: Thy Son hears thee, and will grant thee
whatsoever thou dost ask.<a id="FNanchor_533" href="#Footnote_533" class="fnanchor">[533]</a> Speak, then, speak, oh
Mary our advocate, in behalf of us miserable creatures.
Remember that thou hast received thy great power
and dignity even for our benefit. A God has chosen
to become thy debtor, by taking from thee the human
nature to the end that thou mayest dispense to the
miserable the riches of divine mercy. We are thy
servants, in a special manner consecrated to thy service,
and among these I hope to be one. We glory
in living under thy protection. If thou doest good to
all, even to those that do not know thee and do not
honor thee, and who even insult and blaspheme thee;
how much more ought we to hope from thy kindness,
who dost seek for the wretched that thou mayest relieve
them! we who honor, love, and trust in thee! We
are great sinners, but God has granted thee mercy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span>
and power greater than all our sins. Thou canst and
wilt save us; and we will so much the more earnestly
desire this, as we are unworthy of it, that we
may glorify thee the more in heaven, when we shall
have been received there by thy intercession. Oh,
mother of mercy, we present to thee our souls, once
pure and washed with the blood of Jesus Christ, but
since defiled with sin. To thee we present them,
wilt thou purify them? Obtain for us sincere amendment,
obtain for us the love of God, perseverance,
paradise. We ask great things of thee, but canst
thou not obtain them all for us? Are they greater
than the love which God has for thee? Thou hast
only to open thy lips in prayer to thy Son, and he will
grant thee all things. Pray, then, pray, oh Mary, for
us; and surely thou wilt be heard graciously, and we
shall be surely saved.</p>

<h4 id="CHAPTER_VI_SECTION_II">SECTION II.<br>
MARY IS A MERCIFUL ADVOCATE, WHO DOES NOT REFUSE TO DEFEND
THE CAUSE OF THE MOST MISERABLE SINNERS.</h4>

<p>There are so many reasons why we should love
this our loving queen, that if all the earth should
praise Mary, and all sermons treat of her alone, and
all men should give their lives for Mary, it would yet
be little compared to the homage and gratitude we
owe her, for the very tender love she bears to all men,
even to the most miserable sinners who preserve towards
her any feeling of devotion. Raymond Jordan<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span>
declares that Mary cannot but love those who love her.
Nay she does not disdain even to serve those who serve
her, using, if they are sinners, all the power of her intercession
to obtain pardon for them from her blessed
Son.<a id="FNanchor_534" href="#Footnote_534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a> And so great, he goes on to say, is her kindness
and compassion, that no one, however degraded he may
be, should fear to cast himself at her feet, since she rejects
no one who has recourse to her.<a id="FNanchor_535" href="#Footnote_535" class="fnanchor">[535]</a> Mary, as our
most loving advocate, offers herself to God the prayers
of her servants, especially those which are offered to
her; for as the Son intercedes for us with the Father,
thus she intercedes for us with the Son, and never
ceases to intercede with both for our salvation, and to
obtain for us the favors that we ask.<a id="FNanchor_536" href="#Footnote_536" class="fnanchor">[536]</a> Rightly, then,
does the blessed Denis, the Carthusian, call the holy
Virgin the peculiar refuge of the lost, the hope of the
wretched, and the advocate of all sinners who have
recourse to her.<a id="FNanchor_537" href="#Footnote_537" class="fnanchor">[537]</a></p>

<p>But if there ever be any sinner who, indeed, does
not doubt the power, but has no trust in the mercy of
Mary, fearing that she may not be willing to aid him<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span>
on account of the magnitude of his offences, St. Bonaventure
encourages him by saying: Great and peculiar
is the privilege which Mary has with her Son, of
obtaining by her prayers whatever she desires;<a id="FNanchor_538" href="#Footnote_538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a> but
what would this great power of Mary avail us, he
adds, if she should be indifferent to our welfare?<a id="FNanchor_539" href="#Footnote_539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a>
No, let us not doubt, concludes the saint, let us be
secure, and always thank the Lord and his divine
mother for it; for, as she is the most powerful of all
saints with God, so she is the most loving advocate,
and the most desirous of our welfare.<a id="FNanchor_540" href="#Footnote_540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a> And who,
oh mother of sinners! joyfully exclaims St. Germanus,
who, after thy Jesus, has so much care of us, and of
our welfare, as thou?<a id="FNanchor_541" href="#Footnote_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a> Who doth defend us in the
trials that afflict us, as thou dost defend us? Who
take upon himself to protect sinners, as if combating
in their behalf, as thou dost?<a id="FNanchor_542" href="#Footnote_542" class="fnanchor">[542]</a> Wherefore, he
adds, thy patronage, oh Mary! is more powerful and
loving than we are able to comprehend.<a id="FNanchor_543" href="#Footnote_543" class="fnanchor">[543]</a> Whilst, as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span>
the Idiot says, all the other saints can aid their own
servants by their patronage more than others; the
divine mother, as she is the queen of all, so is she
the advocate of all, and cares for the salvation of
all.<a id="FNanchor_544" href="#Footnote_544" class="fnanchor">[544]</a></p>

<p>She cares for all, even for sinners, and glories especially
in being called their advocate; as she herself
declared to the venerable sister Mary Villani, saying:
“Next to the title of mother of God, I glory most
in being named the advocate of sinners.” The blessed
Amadeus says, that our queen is always before the
divine Majesty, interceding for us with her powerful
prayers.<a id="FNanchor_545" href="#Footnote_545" class="fnanchor">[545]</a> And since in heaven she knows perfectly
our miseries and necessities, she cannot but have pity
on us; so, with the affection of a mother, moved by
compassion for us, she kindly and mercifully endeavors
to relieve and save us.<a id="FNanchor_546" href="#Footnote_546" class="fnanchor">[546]</a> It is with good reason, then,
that Richard of St. Laurence encourages every one,
however degraded he may be, to appeal confidently
to this sweet advocate, in the certain belief that he
will always find her ready to help him.<a id="FNanchor_547" href="#Footnote_547" class="fnanchor">[547]</a> It is also<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span>
well said by Godfrey, that Mary is ever ready to pray
for all.<a id="FNanchor_548" href="#Footnote_548" class="fnanchor">[548]</a></p>

<p>And oh, with how much efficacy and love, St. Bernard
exclaims, this good advocate of ours conducts the
cause of our salvation!<a id="FNanchor_549" href="#Footnote_549" class="fnanchor">[549]</a> St. Augustine, contemplating
the affection and earnestness with which Mary is
continually occupied in interceding with the divine
Majesty for us, that the Lord may pardon our sins,
assist us with his grace, free us from dangers, and relieve
us from our miseries, thus addresses the holy
Virgin:<a id="FNanchor_550" href="#Footnote_550" class="fnanchor">[550]</a> Oh Lady! it is true that all the saints desire
our salvation and pray for us; but the charity and
tenderness which thou dost manifest for us in heaven,
by obtaining with thy prayers so many mercies from
God, obliges us to confess, that we have in heaven
only one advocate, that is thyself, and that thou alone
art the only true lover watchful of our welfare. And
who can comprehend the solicitude with which Mary
is always waiting on God in our behalf? St. Germanus
says: She is never satisfied with defending us:
“Non est satietas defensionis ejus.” The expression
is beautiful. So great is the pity which Mary has for
our miseries, and so great is the love she bears us,
that she prays always, and prays again, and is never<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span>
satisfied with praying for us, and defending us from
evil with her prayers, and obtaining for us favors—she
is never satisfied with defending us.</p>

<p>What poor sinners we should be if we had not this
advocate, so powerful and so merciful, and at the same
time so prudent and so wise, that the judge, her Son,
cannot condemn the guilty, if she defends them, as
Richard of St. Laurence says.<a id="FNanchor_551" href="#Footnote_551" class="fnanchor">[551]</a> Well, then, does St.
John (the geometrician) salute her: Hail, authority
which puts an end to strife.<a id="FNanchor_552" href="#Footnote_552" class="fnanchor">[552]</a> For all the causes defended
by this most wise advocate are gained. Hence
Mary is called by St. Bonaventure, the wise Abigail:
“Abigail sapiens.” This was the woman who, as we
read in the first of Kings, knew so well how to appease
King David, by her persuasive entreaties, when he was
full of indignation against Nabal, that he himself
blessed and thanked her for having, with her sweet
words, prevented him from revenging himself upon
Nabal with his own hands.<a id="FNanchor_553" href="#Footnote_553" class="fnanchor">[553]</a> Precisely the same
thing does Mary continually in heaven, in behalf of
innumerable sinners: she knows so well how to appease
the divine justice with her tender and wise entreaties,
that God himself blesses her for it, and as it
were thanks her, that thus she restrains him from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span>
abandoning and punishing them as they deserve. For
this end, says St. Bernard, the eternal Father, desirous
to show all possible compassion towards us, besides
Jesus Christ, our principal advocate with himself,
has given us Mary for our advocate with Jesus
Christ.</p>

<p>There is no doubt, says St. Bernard, that Jesus is
the only mediator of justice between men and God,
who in virtue of his merits can, and according to his
promises will, obtain for us pardon and divine grace;
but because men recognize and fear in Jesus Christ
the divine majesty, which dwells in him as God, it
was necessary that another advocate should be assigned
to us, to whom we could have recourse with
less fear and more confidence; and this is Mary, than
whom we can find no advocate more powerful with
the divine majesty and more compassionate towards
us.<a id="FNanchor_554" href="#Footnote_554" class="fnanchor">[554]</a> But he would greatly wrong the mercy of Mary,
continues the saint, who should still fear to cast himself
at the feet of this most sweet advocate, who is in
nothing severe or terrible, but is in all things kind,
lovely, and compassionate.<a id="FNanchor_555" href="#Footnote_555" class="fnanchor">[555]</a> Read and revolve as
much as you will all the history found in the Gospels,
and if you find any act of austerity in Mary, then fear<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>
to approach her. But you will never find any; go
then joyfully to her, for she will save thee by her intercession.<a id="FNanchor_556" href="#Footnote_556" class="fnanchor">[556]</a></p>

<p>Exceedingly beautiful is the exclamation which
William of Paris puts in the mouth of a sinner who
has recourse to Mary: Oh mother of my God, I come
to thee full of confidence, even in the miserable state
to which I find myself reduced by my sins; if thou
dost reject me, I will plead with thee, for in a certain
sense thou art bound to help me, since all the Church
of the faithful calls thee and proclaims thee mother of
mercy.<a id="FNanchor_557" href="#Footnote_557" class="fnanchor">[557]</a> Thou, oh Mary, art so dear to God that he
always graciously listens to thee; thy great mercy
has never failed; thy most sweet condescension has
never despised any sinner, however enormous his sins,
who has had recourse to thee.<a id="FNanchor_558" href="#Footnote_558" class="fnanchor">[558]</a> What! could the
whole Church falsely and in vain name thee her advocate
and the refuge of sinners?<a id="FNanchor_559" href="#Footnote_559" class="fnanchor">[559]</a> No, never be
it said that my sins prevent thee, oh my mother,
from exercising the great office of mercy which thou<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span>
dost hold, by which thou art at the same time the advocate
and mediator of peace between God and man,
and next to thy Son the only hope and secure refuge
of sinners.<a id="FNanchor_560" href="#Footnote_560" class="fnanchor">[560]</a> Whatever of grace and glory is thine,
even the dignity of being mother of God itself, if I
may so speak, thou owest to sinners, since for their
sake the divine Word has made thee his mother.<a id="FNanchor_561" href="#Footnote_561" class="fnanchor">[561]</a>
Far from this divine mother, who has brought forth
into the world the fountain of mercy, be the thought
that she should refuse her compassion to any sinner
who recommends himself to her.<a id="FNanchor_562" href="#Footnote_562" class="fnanchor">[562]</a> Since, then, oh
Mary, thy office is that of peacemaker between God
and man, may thy great mercy, which far exceeds all
my sins, move thee to aid me.<a id="FNanchor_563" href="#Footnote_563" class="fnanchor">[563]</a></p>

<p>Console yourselves, then, oh ye faint of heart, I will
say with St. Thomas of Villanova, take heart, oh miserable
sinners; this great Virgin, who is the mother
of your judge and God, is the advocate of the human
race. Powerful and able to obtain whatever she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span>
wishes from God; most wise, for she knows every
method of appeasing him; universal, for she welcomes
all, and refuses to defend none.<a id="FNanchor_564" href="#Footnote_564" class="fnanchor">[564]</a></p>

<h5>EXAMPLE.</h5>

<p>Our advocate has shown how great is her kindness
towards sinners by her mercy to Beatrice, a nun in
the monastery of Fontebraldo, as related by Cesarius,<a id="FNanchor_565" href="#Footnote_565" class="fnanchor">[565]</a>
and by Father Rho.<a id="FNanchor_566" href="#Footnote_566" class="fnanchor">[566]</a> This unhappy religious, having
contracted a passion for a certain youth, agreed to flee
with him from the convent; and in fact she went one
day before a statue of the blessed Virgin, there deposited
the keys of the monastery, for she was portress,
and boldly departed. Arrived in another country,
she led the miserable life of a prostitute for fifteen
years. It happened that she met, one day, the agent
of the monastery in the city where she was living, and
asked of him, thinking he would not recognize her again,
if he knew sister Beatrice? “I know her well,” he
said: “she is a holy nun, and at present is mistress of
novices.” At this intelligence she was confounded
and amazed, not knowing how to understand it. In
order to ascertain the truth, she put on another dress
and went to the monastery. She asked for sister
Beatrice, and behold, the most holy Virgin appeared
before her in the form of that same image to which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span>
at parting she had committed her keys and her dress,
and the divine mother thus spoke to her: “Beatrice, be
it known to thee that, in order to prevent thy disgrace,
I assumed thy form, and have filled thy office for the
fifteen years that thou hast lived far from the monastery
and from God. My child, return, and do penance,
for my Son is still waiting for thee; and strive
by thy holy life to preserve the good name I have
gained thee.” She spoke thus and disappeared.
Beatrice re-entered the monastery, resumed the habit
of a religious, and, grateful for the mercy of Mary, led
the life of a saint. At her death she made known the
foregoing incident, to the glory of this great queen.</p>

<h5>PRAYER.</h5>

<p>Oh great mother of my Lord, I now see that the
ingratitude shown by me for so many years to God
and to thee, would justly merit that thou shouldst
abandon all care of me, for the ungrateful are no more
worthy of favors. But, oh Lady, I have a great idea
of thy goodness; I believe it to be far greater than
my ingratitude; continue, then, oh refuge of sinners,
to help a miserable sinner who confides in thee. Oh
mother of mercy, extend thy hand to raise a poor
fallen creature who implores thy mercy. Oh Mary,
defend thou me, or tell me to whom I shall have recourse,
and who can protect me better than thou?
Can I find an advocate with God more merciful and
more powerful than thou, who art his mother? Thou
having been created for the mother of the Saviour,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span>
art destined to save sinners, and hast been given me
for my salvation. Oh Mary, save him who has recourse
to thee. I do not merit thy love, but the desire
thou hast to save the lost gives me the hope that
thou dost love me; and if thou lovest me, how can I be
lost? Oh my beloved mother, if, as I hope, I am
saved by thee, I will no longer be ungrateful; I will
make amends by perpetual praises and by all the affection
of my soul for my past ingratitude, and will
make some return for the love thou bearest me. In
heaven, where thou reignest and wilt reign forever, I
will always joyfully sing thy mercies, and forever I
will kiss those loving hands that have freed me from
hell as often as I have deserved it for my sins. Oh
Mary, my liberator, my hope, my queen, my advocate,
my mother, I love thee, I wish thee well, and will
always love thee. Amen, amen; thus I hope, so
may it be.</p>

<h4 id="CHAPTER_VI_SECTION_III">SECTION III.<br>
MARY IS THE PEACE-MAKER BETWEEN SINNERS AND GOD.</h4>

<p>The grace of God is a treasure, very great and most
earnestly to be desired by every soul. It is called by
the Holy Spirit an infinite treasure, since by means of
divine grace we are raised to the honor of being made
the friends of God: “She is an infinite treasure to men,
which they that use become the friends of God.”<a id="FNanchor_567" href="#Footnote_567" class="fnanchor">[567]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span>
Whence it is that Jesus, our Redeemer and God, did
not hesitate to call those who are in grace, his friends:
You are my friends: “Vos amici mei estis.”<a id="FNanchor_568" href="#Footnote_568" class="fnanchor">[568]</a> Oh accursed
sin, that loosens the ties of this blessed friendship:
“Your iniquities have divided between you and
your God:”<a id="FNanchor_569" href="#Footnote_569" class="fnanchor">[569]</a> for they make the soul hateful to God,
and from a friend it becomes an enemy of the Lord:
“To God the wicked and his wickedness are hateful
alike.”<a id="FNanchor_570" href="#Footnote_570" class="fnanchor">[570]</a> What, then, must a sinner do who finds himself
so unhappy as to have become an enemy of
God? He must find a mediator who will obtain
pardon for him and enable him to recover the lost
friendship of God. Take courage, says St. Bernard,
oh sinner, who hast lost God. Thy Lord himself
hath given thee a mediator, even his Son Jesus
Christ, who can obtain for thee whatever thou desirest.<a id="FNanchor_571" href="#Footnote_571" class="fnanchor">[571]</a></p>

<p>But oh God, the saint here exclaims, why do men
esteem severe this most merciful Saviour, who hath
given his life for our salvation? Why do they look
upon him as terrible who is all loveliness? Distrustful
sinners, say, why do you fear? If you fear because
you have offended God, remember that Jesus with his
own lacerated hands has nailed your sins to the cross,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span>
and having satisfied the divine justice for them by his
death, he has removed them from your soul.<a id="FNanchor_572" href="#Footnote_572" class="fnanchor">[572]</a> But if
ever, adds the saint, you fear to have recourse to
Jesus Christ because his divine majesty alarms you,
since when he became man he did not cease to be
God, if you ever wish for another advocate with this
mediator, invoke Mary, for she will intercede for you
with the Son, who will surely graciously listen to her,
and the Son will intercede with the Father, who can
refuse nothing to this Son.<a id="FNanchor_573" href="#Footnote_573" class="fnanchor">[573]</a> And so, concludes St.
Bernard, this divine mother, oh my children, is the
ladder of sinners, by which they ascend anew to the
height of divine grace. This is my greatest confidence—this
is the whole ground of my hope.<a id="FNanchor_574" href="#Footnote_574" class="fnanchor">[574]</a></p>

<p>Let us hear what the Holy Spirit makes the blessed
Virgin say in the sacred Canticles:<a id="FNanchor_575" href="#Footnote_575" class="fnanchor">[575]</a> I am, says Mary,
the defence of those who have recourse to me, and
my mercy is to them a tower of refuge; for this I
have been appointed by my Lord as a peacemaker
between sinners and him. Cardinal Hugo, on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>
same text, says, that Mary is the great peacemaker
who obtains from God, and gives peace to enemies,
salvation to the lost, pardon to sinners, and mercy to
the despairing.<a id="FNanchor_576" href="#Footnote_576" class="fnanchor">[576]</a> For this reason she was called by her
divine spouse: Beautiful as the curtains of Solomon:
“Formosa sicut pelles Salomonis.”<a id="FNanchor_577" href="#Footnote_577" class="fnanchor">[577]</a> In the tents of
David there was nothing treated of but war, but in the
tents of Solomon peace alone was spoken of. The Holy
Spirit giving us to understand by this, that the mother
of mercy does not treat of war and of vengeance
against sinners, but only of peace and the pardon
of their offences.</p>

<p>Again, Mary was prefigured by Noe’s dove, who
returned to the ark bearing in her beak the olive-branch,
as a sign of the peace which God granted to
men. Wherefore St. Bonaventure says: Thou art
that most faithful dove, which, mediating with God,
hath obtained for the world, which was lost, peace and
salvation. Mary, then, was the heavenly dove who
brought to the lost world the olive-branch, a sign of
mercy;<a id="FNanchor_578" href="#Footnote_578" class="fnanchor">[578]</a> for she gave us Jesus Christ, who is the
fountain of mercy,<a id="FNanchor_579" href="#Footnote_579" class="fnanchor">[579]</a> and thus obtained, by the price
of his merits, all the graces which God gives us.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span>
And as through Mary the world received celestial
peace,<a id="FNanchor_580" href="#Footnote_580" class="fnanchor">[580]</a> as St. Epiphanius says, so by means of Mary
sinners are constantly becoming reconciled to God.
In the same way, the blessed Albertus Magnus says
in her name: I am that dove of Noe, who brought to
the Church universal peace.<a id="FNanchor_581" href="#Footnote_581" class="fnanchor">[581]</a></p>

<p>Moreover, the rainbow seen by St. John, that surrounded
the throne of God, was also an exact type of
Mary.<a id="FNanchor_582" href="#Footnote_582" class="fnanchor">[582]</a> According to the explanation of Cardinal
Vitalis, Mary is always before the divine tribunal to
mitigate the sentence and punishment due to the sinner.<a id="FNanchor_583" href="#Footnote_583" class="fnanchor">[583]</a>
And St. Bernardine of Sienna says, that it
was of this rainbow that the Lord spoke, when he
said to Noe that he would place in the clouds the
bow of peace, that when he should see it he might
remember the eternal covenant that he had established
with men.<a id="FNanchor_584" href="#Footnote_584" class="fnanchor">[584]</a> And Mary, says St. Bernardine,
is that very bow of eternal peace.<a id="FNanchor_585" href="#Footnote_585" class="fnanchor">[585]</a> For as God, at
the sight of the bow, remembers the peace promised
to the earth, thus, at the prayers of Mary, he pardons<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span>
sinners the offences committed against him, and establishes
peace with them.<a id="FNanchor_586" href="#Footnote_586" class="fnanchor">[586]</a></p>

<p>For the same reason Mary is also compared to the
moon.<a id="FNanchor_587" href="#Footnote_587" class="fnanchor">[587]</a> For, St. Bonaventure says, as the moon is in
the midst between heaven and earth, so she continually
interposes between God and sinners, that she may
appease the Lord towards them, and enlighten them
on their return to God.<a id="FNanchor_588" href="#Footnote_588" class="fnanchor">[588]</a></p>

<p>And this was the most important office given to
Mary when she was placed upon the earth—of lifting
the souls fallen from divine grace, and reconciling
them to God. Feed thy kids: “Pasce hædos tuos.”<a id="FNanchor_589" href="#Footnote_589" class="fnanchor">[589]</a>
This was said to her by the Lord when he created her.
It is well known that sinners are represented by goats;
and as the elect, represented by sheep, will be placed
on the right hand in the valley of judgment, the goats
will be placed on the left. Now these goats, says
William of Paris, are committed to thee, oh great
mother, that thou mayest change them into sheep,
and that those who, by their sins, have merited to be
banished to the left, by thy intercession may be placed
on the right.<a id="FNanchor_590" href="#Footnote_590" class="fnanchor">[590]</a> Hence the Lord revealed to St. Catherine<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span>
of Sienna that he had created this his beloved
child as a sweet bait, that would draw men, and especially
sinners, to God.<a id="FNanchor_591" href="#Footnote_591" class="fnanchor">[591]</a> And here we should note
the beautiful reflection of William, the Englishman, on
the passage above cited, who says, that God recommends
to Mary her own goats, “hædos tuos;” because
the Virgin does not save all sinners, but only
those who serve and honor her. Those, on the contrary,
who live in sin, and do not honor her with any
special devotion, neither recommend themselves to
her in order to escape from their sins, are not the
goats of Mary, but in the judgment will be placed
miserably on the left among the damned.<a id="FNanchor_592" href="#Footnote_592" class="fnanchor">[592]</a></p>

<p>A certain nobleman who was despairing of his eternal
salvation on account of his sins, was encouraged by a
religious to have recourse to the most holy Virgin, by
visiting her sacred image which was in a certain
church. The nobleman went to the church, and on
seeing the figure of Mary he felt himself, as it were,
invited by her to cast himself at her feet and trust.
He hastens to do so, kisses her feet, and Mary, from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span>
that statue, extended her hand for him to kiss, and on
it he saw these words written: “I will deliver thee
from them that afflict thee.”<a id="FNanchor_593" href="#Footnote_593" class="fnanchor">[593]</a> As if she had said to
him: My son, do not despair, for I will deliver thee
from thy sins, and from the fears that oppress thee.
It is related that on reading these sweet words, that
sinner felt such sorrow for his sins, and conceived such
a love for God, and for his sweet mother, that he died
there at the feet of Mary. Oh, how many obstinate
sinners does this magnet of hearts draw daily to God,
as she herself said to St. Bridget: “As the magnet
attracts to itself iron, thus I draw to myself the most
obdurate hearts, that I may reconcile them to God;”<a id="FNanchor_594" href="#Footnote_594" class="fnanchor">[594]</a>
and this prodigy is not rarely, but daily experienced.
I could myself testify to many cases that have occurred
in our missions alone, where sinners who have
remained harder than iron during all other sermons,
while hearing that on the mercy of Mary, were touched
with compunction, and turned to God. St. Gregory
relates that the unicorn is so ferocious a wild beast,
that no hunter can succeed in taking it; but at the
voice of a maiden who calls upon him to surrender,
he draws near, and without resistance allows himself to
be bound by her. Oh, how many sinners, more fierce
than wild beasts, who flee from God, at the sound of
the voice of this great Virgin Mary, advance and allow
themselves to be gently bound by her to God!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span></p>

<p>For this end, says St. John Chrysostom, the Virgin
Mary was made mother of God, that those sinners
who, by reason of their wicked life, could not be
saved according to the divine justice, might obtain
salvation through her sweet compassion and powerful
intercession.<a id="FNanchor_595" href="#Footnote_595" class="fnanchor">[595]</a> St. Anselm confirms this when he
says that Mary has been exalted to be mother of
God for sinners rather than for the just, since Jesus
Christ announced that he came not to call the just,
but sinners.<a id="FNanchor_596" href="#Footnote_596" class="fnanchor">[596]</a> And so the holy Church sings: “Sinners
thou dost not abhor, since but for them thou
never wouldst have been worthy of such a Son.”<a id="FNanchor_597" href="#Footnote_597" class="fnanchor">[597]</a>
William of Paris also says: Oh Mary, thou art
obliged to help sinners, since for all the gifts, graces,
and honors thou dost possess, which are comprehended
in the dignity thou hast received of being the mother
of God, for all, if I may so speak, thou art indebted
to sinners, since for their sakes thou wert made worthy
to have a God for thy Son.<a id="FNanchor_598" href="#Footnote_598" class="fnanchor">[598]</a> If, then, concludes St.
Anselm, Mary, for the sake of sinners, has been made<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span>
mother of God, how can I, however great may be my
sins, despair of pardon?<a id="FNanchor_599" href="#Footnote_599" class="fnanchor">[599]</a></p>

<p>The holy Church teaches us, in the Collect of the
Mass for the Vigil of the Assumption, that the divine
mother has been removed from this earth, that she
might intercede for us with God, in sure confidence of
being graciously heard.<a id="FNanchor_600" href="#Footnote_600" class="fnanchor">[600]</a> Hence Mary is named by
St. Justinian, Arbitress: “Sequestra.” The Word
employed Mary as arbitress.<a id="FNanchor_601" href="#Footnote_601" class="fnanchor">[601]</a> <i>Sequester</i> signifies the
same as arbiter, one to whom two contending parties
refer all their questions; so that the saint means to say,
that as Jesus is mediator with the eternal Father,
so Mary is our mediatrix with Jesus, to whom the
Son refers all the charges which, as judge, he has
against us.</p>

<p>Mary is called by St. Andrew of Crete, the confidence
and security of our reconciliation with God.<a id="FNanchor_602" href="#Footnote_602" class="fnanchor">[602]</a>
And by this the saint intends to say, that God seeks
a reconciliation with sinners by pardoning them, and
that they may not despair of pardon, he has given them
Mary as a pledge of it; hence he salutes her: Hail,
oh peace of God with men: “Salve divina hominibus
reconciliatio.” Wherefore St. Bonaventure says,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span>
encouraging every sinner: If thou fearest, on account
of thy sins, that an angry God may wish to avenge
himself upon thee, what art thou to do? Go to the
hope of sinners, namely, Mary; and if thou fearest
that she will refuse to take thy part, know that
she cannot refuse to defend thy cause, for God himself
has assigned her the office of relieving the
wretched.<a id="FNanchor_603" href="#Footnote_603" class="fnanchor">[603]</a></p>

<p>And what does the Abbot Adam say? Should a
sinner fear being lost, to whom the mother of his
judge offers herself as his mother and advocate?<a id="FNanchor_604" href="#Footnote_604" class="fnanchor">[604]</a>
And then the same writer adds: Oh Mary! who art
mother of mercy, couldst thou refuse to pray thy Son,
who is judge, for another son, who is the criminal?
Canst thou refuse to intercede in behalf of a redeemed
soul with the Redeemer, who, for no other end than
to save sinners, died on the cross?<a id="FNanchor_605" href="#Footnote_605" class="fnanchor">[605]</a> No, thou wilt
not refuse, but earnestly wilt employ thyself in praying
for all those who invoke thee, well knowing that
the same Lord who hath constituted thy Son mediator
of peace between God and man, has at the same
time made thee mediatrix between the Judge and the
criminal.<a id="FNanchor_606" href="#Footnote_606" class="fnanchor">[606]</a> Here St. Bernard takes up the subject,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span>
and says: Give then thanks to him who has provided
thee with such a mediatrix.<a id="FNanchor_607" href="#Footnote_607" class="fnanchor">[607]</a> Whoever thou art, oh
sinner, plunged in the mire of guilt, hoary in sin, do
not despair; thank thy Lord, who, in order to show
mercy to thee, has not only given thee his Son for an
advocate, but, to increase thy confidence and courage,
has provided thee with such a mediatrix, who, by her
prayers, obtains whatever she wishes. Have recourse
to Mary, and thou wilt be saved.</p>

<h5>EXAMPLE.</h5>

<p>It is related by Rupensis,<a id="FNanchor_608" href="#Footnote_608" class="fnanchor">[608]</a> and by Boniface,<a id="FNanchor_609" href="#Footnote_609" class="fnanchor">[609]</a> that
in Florence there lived a young girl, named Benedetta
(the blessed), although she might better have been
called Maladetta (the cursed), from the scandalous and
wicked life she led. Happily for her, St. Dominic
happened to preach in that city, and she, from mere
curiosity, went one day to hear him. But the Lord
touched her heart during the sermon, so that, weeping
bitterly, she went to make her confession to the saint.
St. Dominic heard her confession, gave her absolution,
and directed her to say the rosary. But the unhappy
girl, by the force of her evil habits, returned to her
wicked life. The saint heard of it, and going to her,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span>
induced her to confess once more. God, in order to
confirm her in her good life, one day showed hell to
her, and some persons there who had been already
condemned on her account. Then opening a book, he
made her read in it the frightful record of her sins.
The penitent shuddered at the sight, and, full of confidence,
had recourse to Mary, asked her help, and
learned that this divine mother had already obtained
from God for her, time enough to mourn for her
numerous sins. The vision disappeared, and Benedetta
devoted herself to a good life; but seeing always open
before her eyes that dark catalogue, she one day
prayed in these words to her consoler: “Oh mother, it
is true that for my sins I should now be deep in hell;
but since thou, by thy intercession, hast liberated me
from it, by obtaining for me time for repentance, most
merciful Lady, I ask of thee one other favor. I will
never cease to weep for my sins; but do thou obtain
for me that they may be cancelled from that book.”
After this prayer, Mary appeared to her, and told her
that in order to obtain what she asked, she must preserve
an eternal remembrance of her sins, and of the
mercy of God towards her; and still more, that she
must meditate on the passion of her Son, which he
suffered for love of her; and also that she must bear
in mind that many had been damned who had committed
fewer sins than she had done. She also revealed
to her that a child of only eight years of age,
for one mortal sin only, had been that day condemned
to hell. Benedetta having faithfully obeyed the most<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span>
holy Virgin, one day beheld Jesus Christ, who showed
her that book, and said to her: Behold, thy sins are
cancelled; the book is white, inscribe on it now acts
of love and of virtue. Benedetta did this, led a holy
life, and died a holy death.</p>

<h5>PRAYER.</h5>

<p>Then, oh my most sweet Lady, if thy office is, as
William of Paris says, to interpose as a mediatrix between
the sinner and God,<a id="FNanchor_610" href="#Footnote_610" class="fnanchor">[610]</a> I will say to thee with
St. Thomas of Villanova: Ah, then, oh our advocate,
fulfil thy office.<a id="FNanchor_611" href="#Footnote_611" class="fnanchor">[611]</a> Fulfil at once thy office also in my
behalf. Do not tell me that my cause is too difficult
to be gained; for I know, and all tell me, that no
cause, however desperate, if defended by thee, was
ever lost; and will mine be lost? No, I fear not this.
I have only to fear, when I behold the multitude of
my sins, that thou wilt not undertake my defence;
but considering thy vast compassion and the great
desire that fills thy most loving heart to help the
vilest sinners, I no longer fear even this. And who
was ever lost that had recourse to thee? I invoke,
then, thy aid, oh my great advocate, my refuge, my
hope, and my mother Mary. To thy hands I commit
the cause of my eternal salvation. To thee I consign
my soul; it was lost, but thou must save it. I always
thank the Lord that he gives me this great confidence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span>
in thee, which, notwithstanding my unworthiness, I
believe will secure my salvation. One fear alone remains
to afflict me, my beloved queen: it is, that I may
one day lose, through my neglect, this confidence in
thee. Therefore I pray thee, oh Mary, by all thy love
for thy Jesus, to preserve and increase more and more
in me this most sweet confidence in thy intercession,
by which I certainly hope to recover the divine friendship,
which I have hitherto so foolishly despised and
lost; and once having recovered it, I hope by thy
means to preserve it; and preserving it, I hope finally
through thee to go one day and thank thee for it in
paradise, and there to sing the mercies of God and
thine through all eternity. Amen. Thus I hope,
so may it be, and so it <i>shall be</i>!</p>

MARY IS ALL EYES TO PITY AND RELIEVE OUR MISERIES.</h4>

<p>St. Epiphanius calls the blessed Virgin, “Multoculam;”
that is, one who has many eyes, that she may
relieve our miseries on this earth. One day, when a
person possessed was being exorcised, the devil was
asked by the exorcist what Mary was then doing.
The Evil One replied: “She is descending and ascending:”<a id="FNanchor_612" href="#Footnote_612" class="fnanchor">[612]</a>
by which he intended to say, that this gracious
Lady does nothing else than descend upon the earth
to bring graces to men, and ascend to heaven to obtain
there the divine blessing on our supplications.
Rightly, then, was the holy Virgin named by St.
Andrew of Avellino, the active power of paradise; for
she is continually employed in deeds of mercy, imploring
favors for all, for the just and for sinners.
“The eyes of the Lord are upon the just,” says
David;<a id="FNanchor_613" href="#Footnote_613" class="fnanchor">[613]</a> but the eyes of our Lady are upon the just<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span>
and upon sinners,<a id="FNanchor_614" href="#Footnote_614" class="fnanchor">[614]</a> as Richard of St. Laurence says;
for he adds: The eyes of Mary are the eyes of a
mother; and the mother not only guards her child
from falling, but if he falls, she hastens to raise him.<a id="FNanchor_615" href="#Footnote_615" class="fnanchor">[615]</a></p>

<p>Jesus himself revealed this to St. Bridget, whom
the saint heard one day speaking to his mother, and
saying: “Ask of me, oh my mother, whatever thou
dost desire;”<a id="FNanchor_616" href="#Footnote_616" class="fnanchor">[616]</a> and the Son is always in heaven saying
this to Mary, pleased with granting his beloved
mother whatever she asks. But what does Mary ask?
St. Bridget understood the mother to answer him: I
ask mercy for sinners: “Misericordiam peto pro miseris.”<a id="FNanchor_617" href="#Footnote_617" class="fnanchor">[617]</a>
As if she would say, my Son, thou hast
already destined me for the mother of mercy, for the
refuge of sinners, for the advocate of the miserable,
now thou sayest to me that I may ask whatever I
wish; but what would I ask of thee? I ask of thee
that thou wilt have mercy on the sinner: “Misericordiam
peto pro miseris.” Thou art, oh Mary, so full
of compassion, St. Bonaventure tenderly says to her,
thou art so watchful to relieve the wretched, that it
seems thou hast no other desire, no other concern
than this.<a id="FNanchor_618" href="#Footnote_618" class="fnanchor">[618]</a> And because, among the wretched, sinners
are the most wretched of all, the venerable Bede<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span>
affirms, that Mary is continually praying the Son in
behalf of sinners.<a id="FNanchor_619" href="#Footnote_619" class="fnanchor">[619]</a></p>

<p>Even whilst on earth Mary was so kind and tender
to men that, as St. Jerome says, there never was any
person so afflicted by his own sufferings as Mary by
the sufferings of others.<a id="FNanchor_620" href="#Footnote_620" class="fnanchor">[620]</a> She plainly showed the
compassion she feels for the sufferings of others at
the nuptials of Cana (as has been mentioned in previous
chapters), where, when the wine failed, without
being requested, as St. Bernardine of Sienna remarks,
she assumed the office of a kind comforter.<a id="FNanchor_621" href="#Footnote_621" class="fnanchor">[621]</a> And from
mere compassion for the troubles of that family, she
interceded with her Son, and obtained the miracle
of changing the water into wine.</p>

<p>But, perhaps, says St. Peter Damian, since thou
wast exalted to the dignity of queen of heaven, thou
hast forgotten the wretched; and then he adds, let
this never be thought of—it does not belong to a
mercy so great as that which reigns in the heart of
Mary, to forget such misery as ours.<a id="FNanchor_622" href="#Footnote_622" class="fnanchor">[622]</a> The common
proverb, honors change customs, “Honores mutant
mores,” certainly does not apply to Mary. It, indeed,
applies to worldlings who, when raised to any dignity,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span>
become inflated with pride, and forget their old and
poor friends: but not to Mary, who rejoices in her
greater exaltation, because it gives her more power to
assist others. Considering this point, St. Bonaventure
applies to the blessed Virgin the words spoken to
Ruth: “Blessed art thou, my daughter, and thy latter
kindness has surpassed the former.”<a id="FNanchor_623" href="#Footnote_623" class="fnanchor">[623]</a> Meaning, as he
afterwards explains, that if the pity of Mary for the
unhappy was great when she lived on earth, much
greater is it now when she is reigning in heaven.<a id="FNanchor_624" href="#Footnote_624" class="fnanchor">[624]</a>
The saint gives the reason for this by saying, that the
divine mother shows now, by the innumerable favors
she obtains for us, this her increased compassion,
because now she better understands our miseries.<a id="FNanchor_625" href="#Footnote_625" class="fnanchor">[625]</a>
And he adds, that as the splendor of the sun exceeds
that of the moon, so the mercy of Mary, now that
she is in heaven, exceeds the mercy she had for us when
she was upon the earth.<a id="FNanchor_626" href="#Footnote_626" class="fnanchor">[626]</a> And is there any one living
on the earth who does not enjoy the light of the sun?—any
one on whom this mercy of Mary does not shine?<a id="FNanchor_627" href="#Footnote_627" class="fnanchor">[627]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span></p>

<p>On this account she is called bright as the sun,
“Electa ut sol;”<a id="FNanchor_628" href="#Footnote_628" class="fnanchor">[628]</a> because no one is shut out from the
heat of this sun,<a id="FNanchor_629" href="#Footnote_629" class="fnanchor">[629]</a> as St. Bonaventure says. And St.
Agnes revealed this from heaven to St. Bridget, when
she said to her, that our queen, now that she is united
with her Son in heaven, cannot forget her innate goodness;
hence she exercises her compassion towards all,
even towards the most impious sinners, so that as both
the celestial and terrestrial bodies are illuminated by
the sun, thus through the goodness of Mary, there is
no one in the world who does not, if he asks for it,
share in the divine mercy.<a id="FNanchor_630" href="#Footnote_630" class="fnanchor">[630]</a> A great and desperate
sinner, in the kingdom of Valencia, in order to escape
justice, had resolved to become a Turk, and was actually
going to embark, when by chance he passed a
church, in which Father Jerome Lopez, of the Company
of Jesus, was preaching, and preaching of the
divine mercy; by that preaching he was converted,
and confessed to the father, who inquired of him if
he had practised any devotion, for which God had
shown towards him that great mercy; he answered
that he had practised no other devotion than praying
the holy Virgin every day not to abandon him.<a id="FNanchor_631" href="#Footnote_631" class="fnanchor">[631]</a> The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[246]</span>
same Father found in the hospital a sinner, who for fifty-five
years had never been to confession, and had only
practised this little devotion, that when he saw an
image of Mary he saluted it, and prayed to her that
he might not die in mortal sin; and then he related
that in a quarrel with an enemy, his sword was broken,
and he turned to the Madonna saying: “Alas, I shall
be slain, and damned; oh mother of sinners, help me.”
When he had said this, he found himself, he knew
not how, transported into a secure place. He made
a general confession, and died full of confidence.<a id="FNanchor_632" href="#Footnote_632" class="fnanchor">[632]</a></p>

<p>St. Bernard writes that Mary becomes all things to
all men, and opens to all the bowels of her mercy,
that all may receive of her; the captive his freedom;
the sick man health; the afflicted consolation; the
sinner pardon, and God glory: hence there is no one,
since she is the sun, who does not partake of her
warmth.<a id="FNanchor_633" href="#Footnote_633" class="fnanchor">[633]</a> And is there any one in the world, exclaims
St. Bonaventure, who will not love this lovely
queen? She is more beautiful than the sun, and
sweeter than honey; she is a treasure of goodness,
and is kind and courteous to all.<a id="FNanchor_634" href="#Footnote_634" class="fnanchor">[634]</a> I salute thee, then,
thus the enamored saint goes on to say, oh my Lady<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span>
and mother! my heart! my soul! Pardon me, oh
Mary, if I say that I love thee: if I am not worthy
of loving thee, thou art truly worthy of being loved
by me.<a id="FNanchor_635" href="#Footnote_635" class="fnanchor">[635]</a></p>

<p>It was revealed to St. Gertrude,<a id="FNanchor_636" href="#Footnote_636" class="fnanchor">[636]</a> that when any
one repeats with devotion these words to the Virgin:
“Turn, then, towards us, oh our advocate, thy pitying
eyes,”<a id="FNanchor_637" href="#Footnote_637" class="fnanchor">[637]</a> Mary never fails to listen to the prayer. Oh,
let the immensity of thy mercy, oh great Lady, fill the
whole earth, exclaims St. Bernard.<a id="FNanchor_638" href="#Footnote_638" class="fnanchor">[638]</a> Whence St.
Bonaventure says, that this loving mother has such a
desire to do good to all, that she feels herself offended
not only by those who offer her some positive injury,
for there are souls to be found so perverse, especially
gamesters, who sometimes, to vent their anger, blaspheme
and insult this good Lady, but she looks upon
herself as injured by those, also, who neglect to
ask of her some favor.<a id="FNanchor_639" href="#Footnote_639" class="fnanchor">[639]</a> So that, as St. Idelbert
says, thou dost instruct us, oh Lady, to expect
favors greater than our merits, for thou dost never<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span>
cease to dispense graces that far exceed what we
merit.<a id="FNanchor_640" href="#Footnote_640" class="fnanchor">[640]</a></p>

<p>The prophet Isaias predicted that by the great
work of human redemption, a great throne of divine
mercy would be prepared for us: “A throne shall be
prepared in mercy.”<a id="FNanchor_641" href="#Footnote_641" class="fnanchor">[641]</a> Who is this throne? St. Bonaventure
answers: This throne is Mary, in whom all,
both the just and sinners, find the consolations of
mercy;<a id="FNanchor_642" href="#Footnote_642" class="fnanchor">[642]</a> and he afterwards adds: As the Lord is full
of compassion, so also is our Lady; and as the Son, so
the mother cannot withhold her mercy from those
who ask it.<a id="FNanchor_643" href="#Footnote_643" class="fnanchor">[643]</a> Hence Guerric, the abbot, represents
Jesus thus speaking to Mary: My mother, upon thee
I will establish the seat of my kingdom, for through
thee will I bestow the graces that are asked of me:
thou hast given me the human nature; I will give to
thee, as it were, a divine nature, that is, my omnipotence,
by which thou canst assist all who invoke thee
to obtain their salvation.<a id="FNanchor_644" href="#Footnote_644" class="fnanchor">[644]</a></p>

<p>When St. Gertrude was one day devoutly repeating<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span>
these words to the divine mother: “Turn towards us
thy merciful eyes,” she saw the Virgin pointing to the
eyes of her Son whom she held in her arms, and she
said to her: “These are the most merciful eyes that I
can turn towards all those who invoke me for their salvation.”<a id="FNanchor_645" href="#Footnote_645" class="fnanchor">[645]</a>
A sinner once weeping before the altar of
Mary, and imploring her to intercede with God for
his pardon, was given to understand that the blessed
Virgin turned to the child whom she held in her arms,
and said to him: “My son, shall these tears be in
vain?”<a id="FNanchor_646" href="#Footnote_646" class="fnanchor">[646]</a> and he learned that Jesus Christ at once pardoned
him.</p>

<p>And how can any one ever perish who recommends
himself to this good mother, when the Son, as God,
has promised, for love of her, to exercise mercy, as far
as it pleases her, towards all those that have recourse
to her? Precisely this our Lord revealed to St. Bridget;
permitting her to hear these words which he
spoke to Mary: “By my omnipotence, venerated
mother, I have granted thee the pardon of all sinners,
in whatever way it pleases thee, who devoutly invoke
the aid of thy mercy.”<a id="FNanchor_647" href="#Footnote_647" class="fnanchor">[647]</a> Hence the Abbot Adam
Persenius, considering the great compassion that Mary
has for all, full of confidence says to her: Oh mother<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span>
of mercy, thy power is as great as thy pity. As thou
art powerful to obtain, so thou art merciful to pardon.<a id="FNanchor_648" href="#Footnote_648" class="fnanchor">[648]</a>
And when, he adds, dost thou ever fail to
have compassion on sinners, being the mother of
mercy; or art thou unable to help them, being mother
of omnipotence? Ah, thou canst as readily obtain
whatever thou wilt, as thou canst listen to our woes.<a id="FNanchor_649" href="#Footnote_649" class="fnanchor">[649]</a>
Satiate thyself, then, says the Abbot Rupert, satiate
thyself, oh great queen, with the glory of thy Son, and
through thy compassion, not certainly through our
merit, be pleased to send down to us, thy poor servants
here below, whatever fragments may remain.<a id="FNanchor_650" href="#Footnote_650" class="fnanchor">[650]</a></p>

<p>If our sins ever throw us into despair, let us say
with William of Paris: Oh Lady, do not bring forward
my sins against me, for I shall bring forward thy
mercy in opposition to them. And let it never be
said that my sins can rival, in the judgment, thy
mercy, which is more powerful to obtain my pardon,
than my sins are to obtain my condemnation.<a id="FNanchor_651" href="#Footnote_651" class="fnanchor">[651]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span></p>

<h5>EXAMPLE.</h5>

<p>We read in the chronicles of the Capuchin Fathers,<a id="FNanchor_652" href="#Footnote_652" class="fnanchor">[652]</a>
that there lived in Venice a celebrated advocate, who,
by fraud and evil practices, had become rich. His
whole life was very bad, and it appears that he had but
one good habit, that of reciting every day a certain
prayer to the holy Virgin. Yet, even this little devotion
saved him from eternal death, through the mercy of
Mary. It happened in this way: Happily for himself,
he had a great esteem for Father Matthew da Basso, and
urged him so much to come and dine at his house, that
one day the Father gave him this pleasure. Having arrived,
the advocate said to him: “Now, Father, I will
show you something that you have never seen. I have
a wonderful ape, who is my valet, washes my glasses,
lays the table, and opens the door.” “This may not be
an ape,” answered the Father: “it may be something
more than an ape; order him to come here.” The
ape was called again and again, search was made for
him everywhere, and he could not be found. At length,
he was discovered hidden under a bed in the lower
part of the house, but he would not come out. “Come,
then,” said the religious, “let us go and see him:” and
he went with the advocate to his hiding-place. “Infernal
beast,” he said, “come forth, and in the name
of God I command you to tell me what you are.”
And behold, the ape answered that he was the devil,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span>
and that he was waiting until that sinner should omit
some day to recite his accustomed prayer to the
mother of God; for the first time he should omit it,
God had given him leave to strangle him, and take
him to hell. At these words the advocate cast himself
upon his knees to ask help of the servant of God,
who encouraged him, and commanded the devil to
depart from that house without committing any injury,
only he gave him permission, as a sign that he
had really gone, to break a piece of the wall. Scarcely
had he finished speaking, when, with a great crash, a
hole was made in the wall, which, although it was
several times closed with stone and mortar, God willed
that it should remain open for a long time; until, by the
advice of the servant of God, it was filled up with a
slab of marble, with an angel carved on it. The advocate
was converted, and, it is to be hoped, persevered
until death in his new course of life.</p>

<h5>PRAYER.</h5>

<p>Oh creature, among all others the greatest and
most sublime, most holy Virgin, I from this earth salute
thee; I, a miserable, unhappy rebel to my God,
who deserve punishment and not favors, justice and
not mercy. Oh Lady, I do not say this because I
distrust thy mercy. I know that thou dost glory in
being merciful as thou art great. I know that thou
dost rejoice in being so rich, that thou mayest share
thy riches with us sinners. I know that the more
wretched are those who seek thee, the greater is thy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span>
desire to help and save them. Oh my mother, it is
thou who once did weep for thy Son when he died
for me. Offer, I pray thee, thy tears to God, and
with these obtain for me a true sorrow for my sins.
So much did sinners grieve thee, then, and so much
did I, too, grieve thee by my iniquities. Obtain for
me, oh Mary, that I at least from henceforth may no
longer continue to afflict thee and thy Son by my ingratitude.
What will thy tears avail me if I should
continue to be ungrateful to thee? What would thy
mercy avail me if I should again be faithless and be
lost? No, my queen, do not permit it. Thou hast
supplied all my deficiencies; thou canst obtain from
God whatever thou wilt; thou graciously hearest
every one that prays to thee. These two favors do I
ask of thee, and at all events from thee do I hope and
desire them: namely, that thou wilt obtain for me to
be faithful to God by never more offending him, and
to love him as much as I have offended him during
the life that remains to me.</p>

MARY RESCUES HER SERVANTS FROM HELL.</h4>

<p>It is impossible that a servant of Mary who faithfully
honors her and recommends himself to her should
be lost. This proposition at first sight may appear to
some persons extravagant. But I would beg them
not to condemn it before reading what will hereafter
be said on this point. When it is said that a devoted
servant of Mary cannot be lost, those servants are not
intended who abuse their devotion by sinning with less
fear. Therefore it is unjust to say, as some do who
disapprove extolling the mercy of Mary to sinners,
that by so doing they are encouraged to sin the more;
for such presumptuous persons for their presumption
merit punishment and not mercy. It is understood,
then only of those of her servants who, with the desire
to amend, faithfully honor and commend themselves
to the mother of God. That these should be
lost is, I say, morally impossible. And I find Father<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span>
Crasset has affirmed the same thing in his book upon
devotion to Mary;<a id="FNanchor_653" href="#Footnote_653" class="fnanchor">[653]</a> and before him Vega,<a id="FNanchor_654" href="#Footnote_654" class="fnanchor">[654]</a>
    Mendoza,<a id="FNanchor_655" href="#Footnote_655" class="fnanchor">[655]</a>
and other theologians. And that we may know that
they have not spoken unadvisedly, let us see what the
Doctors and Saints have said on this subject. Let no
one be surprised if I here quote several sentences, of
different authors, containing the same thing; for I
have wished to record them all, in order to show how
unanimously all writers agree on this point. St. Anselm
says, that as he who is not devoted to Mary and
protected by her cannot be saved, so it is impossible
that he should be condemned who recommends himself
to the Virgin, and is regarded by her with
affection.<a id="FNanchor_656" href="#Footnote_656" class="fnanchor">[656]</a> St. Antoninus asserts the same thing in
nearly the same words: As it is impossible that those
from whom Mary turns away her eyes of compassion
should be saved, so it must be that all those towards
whom she turns her eyes, and for whom she intercedes,
shall be saved and glorified.<a id="FNanchor_657" href="#Footnote_657" class="fnanchor">[657]</a> This saint adds, then,
that the servants of Mary must necessarily be saved.</p>

<p>Let us note, however, the first part of the statements<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span>
of these saints, and let those tremble who
little esteem, or abandon through negligence, devotion
to this divine mother. They say that it is impossible
for those to be saved who are not protected by
Mary. And this is also asserted by others, as the
blessed Albertus Magnus: All those who are not thy
servants, oh Mary, shall perish: “Gens quæ non servierit
tibi peribit.”<a id="FNanchor_658" href="#Footnote_658" class="fnanchor">[658]</a> St. Bonaventure, too: He who
neglects the service of Mary shall die in sin.<a id="FNanchor_659" href="#Footnote_659" class="fnanchor">[659]</a> And
in another place: He who has not recourse to thee, oh
Lady, will not reach paradise.<a id="FNanchor_660" href="#Footnote_660" class="fnanchor">[660]</a> And on Psalm xcix. the
saint goes so far as to say that those from whom Mary
turns away her face, not only will not be saved, but
can have no hope of salvation.<a id="FNanchor_661" href="#Footnote_661" class="fnanchor">[661]</a> And before this St.
Ignatius, the martyr, said the same thing, asserting that
a sinner cannot be saved except by means of the holy
Virgin, who, on the other hand, saves by her merciful
intercession many that would be condemned by the
divine justice.<a id="FNanchor_662" href="#Footnote_662" class="fnanchor">[662]</a> Some persons doubt whether this
passage is from St. Ignatius; at least Father Crasset
says that St. John Chrysostom has adopted it as his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[257]</span>
own.<a id="FNanchor_663" href="#Footnote_663" class="fnanchor">[663]</a> It is also repeated by the Abbot of Celles.<a id="FNanchor_664" href="#Footnote_664" class="fnanchor">[664]</a>
And in the same sense the holy Church applies to
Mary these words of Proverbs: All that hate me
love death: “Omnes qui me oderunt, diligunt mortem.”<a id="FNanchor_665" href="#Footnote_665" class="fnanchor">[665]</a>
For, as Richard of St. Laurence says, commenting
on the words: She is like the merchant’s
ship:<a id="FNanchor_666" href="#Footnote_666" class="fnanchor">[666]</a> all those who are out of this ship shall be submerged
in the sea of this world.<a id="FNanchor_667" href="#Footnote_667" class="fnanchor">[667]</a> Even the heretic
Œcolampadius esteemed neglect of devotion in any
one to the mother of God as a certain sign of
reprobation; hence, he said: Let it never be heard of
me that I am averse to Mary, to be ill affected towards
whom I should think a certain sign of a reprobate
mind.<a id="FNanchor_668" href="#Footnote_668" class="fnanchor">[668]</a></p>

<p>On the other hand, Mary says: He that hearkeneth
to me shall not be confounded.<a id="FNanchor_669" href="#Footnote_669" class="fnanchor">[669]</a> He who
has recourse to me, and listens to what I say to
him, shall not be lost. From which St. Bonaventure
said: Oh, Lady, those who are mindful to honor
thee, shall be far from perdition.<a id="FNanchor_670" href="#Footnote_670" class="fnanchor">[670]</a> Even when, as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span>
St. Hilary says, they have hitherto deeply offended
God.<a id="FNanchor_671" href="#Footnote_671" class="fnanchor">[671]</a></p>

<p>Hence the devil strives so hard with sinners, in
order that, having lost divine grace, they may also lose
devotion to Mary. Sarah, seeing Isaac playing with
Ishmael, who was teaching him evil habits, asked
Abraham to send him away, and his mother Agar
also: “Cast out this bond-woman and her son.”<a id="FNanchor_672" href="#Footnote_672" class="fnanchor">[672]</a>
She was not satisfied that the son alone should leave
the house without the mother, fearing lest the son
would come to visit his mother, and thus continue to
frequent the house. In like manner, the devil is not
satisfied with seeing Jesus cast out from a soul, if he
does not see the mother also cast out: “Cast out this
bond-woman and her son.” Otherwise he fears that
the mother, by her intercession, may again obtain the
return of her son. And he has cause to fear, for as
the learned Father Paciucchelli remarks: He who is
faithful in honoring the mother of God, through
Mary, will soon receive him.<a id="FNanchor_673" href="#Footnote_673" class="fnanchor">[673]</a> Therefore rightly was the
devotion to our Lady called by St. Ephrem: The
passport of escape from hell: “Charta libertatis.”<a id="FNanchor_674" href="#Footnote_674" class="fnanchor">[674]</a>
The divine mother was also named by him: The
protectress of the condemned: “Patrocinatrix damnatorum.”
And with truth St. Bernard says, that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[259]</span>
Mary is neither wanting in the power nor the
will to save us.<a id="FNanchor_675" href="#Footnote_675" class="fnanchor">[675]</a> Not in the power, because it
is impossible that her prayers should not be heard,
as St. Antoninus asserts;<a id="FNanchor_676" href="#Footnote_676" class="fnanchor">[676]</a> and St. Bonaventure says
also, that her requests cannot be unavailing, but obtain
for her what she wishes: Quod quærit invenit et frustrari
non potest.<a id="FNanchor_677" href="#Footnote_677" class="fnanchor">[677]</a> Not in the will to save us, for
Mary is our mother, and desires our salvation more
than we desire it ourselves. If this is then true, how
can it ever happen that a servant of Mary should be
lost? He may be a sinner, but if, with perseverance
and a desire for amendment, he commends himself to
this good mother, she will take care to obtain for him
light to guide him out of his bad state, contrition for
his sins, perseverance in goodness, and finally a good
death. And is there any mother who would not rescue
her child from death, if she could do it by praying
his judge for mercy? And can we believe that Mary,
the most loving mother possible to her servants, would
fail to rescue one of them from eternal death, when
she can do it so easily?</p>

<p>Ah, devout reader, let us thank the Lord, if we find
that he has given us the love of the queen of heaven,
and confidence in her; for God, as St. John Damascene
says, does not grant this grace except to those
whom he wishes to save. These are the beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[260]</span>
words of the saint, with which he would quicken his
own and our hope: Oh mother of God, if I place
my confidence in thee I shall be saved. If I am
under thy protection, I have nothing to fear, because
to be thy servant is to have certain arms of salvation,
which God only grants to those whom he will save.<a id="FNanchor_678" href="#Footnote_678" class="fnanchor">[678]</a>
Hence Erasmus thus salutes the Virgin: Hail, terror
of hell! hail, hope of Christians! confidence in thee
secures salvation.<a id="FNanchor_679" href="#Footnote_679" class="fnanchor">[679]</a></p>

<p>Oh, how much it grieves the devil to see a soul
persevering in its devotion to the divine mother! We
read in the life of Father Alphonsus Alvarez, who had
a special devotion to Mary, that being in prayer, and
finding himself tormented by impure temptations with
which the devil afflicted him, the enemy said to him: Quit
thy devotion to Mary, and I will cease to tempt thee.</p>

<p>The Lord revealed to St. Catherine of Sienna, as
we read in Blosius, that he, in his goodness, had
granted to Mary, from love to his only begotten Son,
whose mother she is, that not even one sinner, who
commends himself devoutly to her, should be the prey
of hell.<a id="FNanchor_680" href="#Footnote_680" class="fnanchor">[680]</a> The Prophet David, too, prayed to be rescued
from hell, for the honor in which he held Mary:
“I have loved, oh Lord, the beauty of thy house;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>[261]</span>
take not away my soul with the wicked.”<a id="FNanchor_681" href="#Footnote_681" class="fnanchor">[681]</a> He says
of thy house, “Domus tuæ,” because Mary was, indeed,
that house of God, which he himself, when he
became man, built on this earth for his habitation, and
for the place of his rest, as we read in Proverbs:
Wisdom hath built herself a house.<a id="FNanchor_682" href="#Footnote_682" class="fnanchor">[682]</a> No, he surely
will not be lost, says St. Ignatius, the martyr, who is
constant in his devotion to this virgin mother.<a id="FNanchor_683" href="#Footnote_683" class="fnanchor">[683]</a> And
this is confirmed by St. Bonaventure, who says: Oh
Lady, those who love thee enjoy great peace in this
life, and in the other they shall not see eternal death.<a id="FNanchor_684" href="#Footnote_684" class="fnanchor">[684]</a>
No, for it never did, and never will happen, as the
devout Blosius assures us, that an humble and constant
servant of Mary will be lost.<a id="FNanchor_685" href="#Footnote_685" class="fnanchor">[685]</a></p>

<p>Oh, how many would have been eternally condemned,
or remained in obstinacy, if Mary had not interceded
with her Son to exercise mercy! Thus says
Thomas à Kempis.<a id="FNanchor_686" href="#Footnote_686" class="fnanchor">[686]</a> And it is the opinion of many
doctors, especially of St. Thomas, that the divine
mother has obtained from God a reprieve for many<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[262]</span>
persons who had even died in mortal sin, and their return
to life to do penance. We have many examples
of this given by writers of good authority. Among
others, Flodoard, who lived about the ninth century,
narrates, in his chronicles,<a id="FNanchor_687" href="#Footnote_687" class="fnanchor">[687]</a> that one Adelman, a deacon,
who appeared to be dead, was about to be buried,
when he returned to life, and said, that he had seen
the place in hell to which he had already been condemned;
but that, through the intercession of the
blessed Virgin, he had been sent back to earth to do
penance. Surius also relates, that a Roman citizen,
named Andrew, had died without doing penance, and
that Mary had obtained his return to life that he
might procure pardon.<a id="FNanchor_688" href="#Footnote_688" class="fnanchor">[688]</a> Pelbart, moreover, relates,
that in his time, when the Emperor Sigismund was
crossing the Alps with his army, a voice was heard,
proceeding from a dead body, of which only the bones
remained, asking for confession, and saying, that the
mother of God, to whom he had been devoted whilst
he was a soldier, had obtained for him that he should
live in those bones until he had made his confession.
Having confessed, he died.<a id="FNanchor_689" href="#Footnote_689" class="fnanchor">[689]</a> These and similar examples
must not serve as encouragement for some rash
person who would live in sin, in the hope that Mary
would free him from hell, even if he should die in sin;
for as it would be a great folly to throw one’s self into a
well, in the hope that Mary would save us from death,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>[263]</span>
because the Virgin has rescued some persons under
similar circumstances; thus a greater folly would it
be for one to run the risk of dying in sin, on the presumption
that the holy Virgin would rescue him from
hell. But these examples should serve to strengthen
our confidence by the consideration, that if the intercession
of this divine mother could deliver those from
hell—even those who have died in sin—how much
more will it prevent those from falling into hell who
in life have recourse to her with the intention to
amend and serve her faithfully?</p>

<p>Then, oh our mother, let us say with St. Germanus:
What will become of us who are sinners, but who wish
to amend and have recourse to thee, who art the life
of Christians?<a id="FNanchor_690" href="#Footnote_690" class="fnanchor">[690]</a> Let us, oh Lady, hear what St. Anselm
says of thee, that he will not be lost for whom
thou hast once offered thy prayers.<a id="FNanchor_691" href="#Footnote_691" class="fnanchor">[691]</a> Pray, then, for
us, and we shall be saved from hell. Who will tell
me, says Richard of Victor, that when I am presented
at the divine tribunal, the Judge will not be favorable
to me, if I shall have thee to defend my cause, oh
mother of mercy?<a id="FNanchor_692" href="#Footnote_692" class="fnanchor">[692]</a> And the blessed Henry Suso
declared, that he had placed his soul in the care of
Mary, and he said, that if the Judge wished to condemn
him, he would have the sentence pass through the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264"></a>[264]</span>
hands of Mary.<a id="FNanchor_693" href="#Footnote_693" class="fnanchor">[693]</a> For he hoped that when the sentence
of condemnation should fall into the kind hands
of the Virgin, its execution would certainly be prevented.
I ask and hope the same for myself, oh my
most holy queen. Whence I will always repeat with
St. Bonaventure: Oh Lady, in thee I have placed all
my hopes, therefore I securely hope not to be lost,
but safe in heaven to praise and love thee forever.<a id="FNanchor_694" href="#Footnote_694" class="fnanchor">[694]</a></p>

<h5>EXAMPLE.</h5>

<p>In the year 1604 there lived in a city of Flanders
two young students, who, instead of attending to their
studies, gave themselves up to excesses and dissipation.
One night, having gone to the house of a woman of
ill fame, one of them, named Richard, after some time
returned home, but the other remained. Richard
having gone home, was undressing to go to rest, when
he remembered that he had not recited that day, as
usual, some “Hail Marys.” He was oppressed with
sleep and very weary, yet he roused himself and recited
them, although without devotion, and only half
awake. He then went to bed, and having just fallen
asleep, he heard a loud knocking at the door, and
immediately after, before he had time to open it, he
saw before him his companion, with a hideous and
ghastly appearance. “Who are you?” he said to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[265]</span>
him. “Do you not know me?” answered the other.
“But what has so changed you? you seem like a
demon.” “Alas!” exclaimed this poor wretch, “I
am damned.” “And how is this?” “Know,” he
said, “that when I came out of that infamous house,
a devil attacked me and strangled me. My body lies
in the middle of the street, and my soul is in hell.
Know that my punishment would also have been yours,
but the blessed Virgin, on account of those few ‘Hail
Marys’ said in her honor, has saved you. Happy
will it be for you, if you know how to avail yourself
of this warning, that the mother of God sends you
through me.” After these words he opened his cloak,
showed the fire and serpents that were consuming
him, and then disappeared. Then the youth, bursting
into a flood of tears, threw himself with his face
on the ground, to thank Mary, his deliverer, and
while he was revolving in his mind a change of life,
he hears the matin bell of a neighboring Franciscan
Monastery. “It is there,” he exclaimed, “that God
calls me to do penance.” He went immediately to the
convent to beg the fathers to receive him. Knowing
how bad his life had been, they objected. But after he
had related the circumstance which had brought him
there, weeping bitterly all the while, two of the fathers
went out to search in the street, and actually found
there the dead body of his companion, having the marks
of strangulation, and black as a coal. Whereupon
the young man was received. Richard from that time
led an exemplary life. He went into India to preach<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266"></a>[266]</span>
the faith; from thence passed to Japan, and finally had
the good fortune and received the grace of dying a
martyr for Jesus Christ, by being burned alive.<a id="FNanchor_695" href="#Footnote_695" class="fnanchor">[695]</a></p>

<h5>PRAYER.</h5>

<p>Oh Mary! oh my most dear mother! in what an
abyss of evil I should find myself, if thou, with thy
kind hand, hadst not so often preserved me! Yea,
how many years should I already have been in hell,
if thou, with thy powerful prayers, hadst not rescued
me! My grievous sins were hurrying me there; divine
justice had already condemned me; the raging demons
were waiting to execute the sentence; but thou didst
appear, oh mother, not invoked nor asked by me,
and hast saved me. Oh my dear deliverer, what return
can I make thee for so much grace and so much
love? Thou hast overcome the hardness of my heart,
and hast drawn me to love thee and confide in thee.
And oh, into what an abyss of evils I afterwards
should have fallen, if thou, with thy kind hand, hadst
not so many times protected me from the dangers
into which I was on the brink of falling! Continue,
oh my hope, continue to save me from hell, but first
of all from the sins into which I might again fall. Do
not permit that I shall have to curse thee in hell. My
beloved Lady, I love thee, and how can thy goodness
endure to see one of thy servants who loves thee,
lost? Ah, obtain for me the grace to be no longer<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>[267]</span>
ungrateful to thee and to my God, who for love of
thee hath granted me so many favors. Oh Mary,
what dost thou say to me? Shall I be lost? I shall
be lost if I leave thee. But who will any more venture
to forsake thee? Shall I ever forget thy love for
me? Thou, after God, art the love of my soul. I
dare live no longer without loving thee. I bless thee!
I love thee! and I hope that I shall always love thee
in time and in eternity, oh creature most beautiful!
most holy! most sweet! most amiable of all creatures
in this world! Amen.</p>

MARY ASSISTS HER SERVANTS IN PURGATORY.</h4>

<p>Too happy are the servants of this most kind
mother, since not only in this world they are aided by
her, but also in purgatory they are assisted and consoled
by her protection. For succor being there more
needed, because they are in torment and cannot help
themselves, so much the more does this mother of
mercy strive to help them. St. Bernardine of Sienna
says, that in that prison of souls who are spouses of
Jesus Christ, Mary has a certain dominion and plenitude
of power to relieve them, as well as deliver them
from their pains.<a id="FNanchor_696" href="#Footnote_696" class="fnanchor">[696]</a></p>

<p>And, in the first place, as to relieving them, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>[268]</span>
same saint, applying the words of Ecclesiasticus: I
have walked in the waves of the sea: “In fluctibus
maris ambulavi,”<a id="FNanchor_697" href="#Footnote_697" class="fnanchor">[697]</a> adds, visiting and relieving the
necessities and sufferings of my servants, who are my
children.<a id="FNanchor_698" href="#Footnote_698" class="fnanchor">[698]</a> St. Bernardine says, that the pains of
purgatory are called waves, because they are transitory,
unlike the pains of hell, which never end; and
they are called waves of the sea, because they are
very bitter pains. The servants of Mary tormented
by those pains are often visited and succored by her.
See, then, how important it is, says Novarino, to be
a servant of this good Lady; for she never forgets
such when they are suffering in those flames. And
although Mary succors all the souls in purgatory, yet
she always obtains more indulgences and alleviations
for those who have been especially devoted to her.<a id="FNanchor_699" href="#Footnote_699" class="fnanchor">[699]</a></p>

<p>This divine mother, in her revelations to St. Bridget,
said: “I am the mother of all the souls in purgatory;
and all the sufferings which they merit for the sins
committed in life are every hour, while they remain
there, alleviated in some measure by my prayers.”<a id="FNanchor_700" href="#Footnote_700" class="fnanchor">[700]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>[269]</span>
This kind mother sometimes condescends even to
enter into that holy prison, to visit and console these
her afflicted children. I have penetrated into the bottom
of the deep: “Profundum abyssi penetravi,” as
we read in Ecclesiasticus;<a id="FNanchor_701" href="#Footnote_701" class="fnanchor">[701]</a> and St. Bonaventure, applying
these words, adds: I have penetrated the depth
of this abyss, that is, of purgatory, to relieve by my
presence those holy souls.<a id="FNanchor_702" href="#Footnote_702" class="fnanchor">[702]</a> Oh, how kind and beneficent
is the holy Virgin to those who are suffering in
purgatory! says St. Vincent Ferrer; through her they
receive continual consolation and refreshment.<a id="FNanchor_703" href="#Footnote_703" class="fnanchor">[703]</a></p>

<p>And what other consolation have they in their sufferings
than Mary, and the help of this mother of
mercy? St. Bridget one day heard Jesus saying to
his mother: “Thou art my mother, thou art the mother
of mercy, thou art the consoler of those who are
in purgatory.”<a id="FNanchor_704" href="#Footnote_704" class="fnanchor">[704]</a> And the blessed Virgin herself said
to St. Bridget, that as a poor sick person, suffering
and deserted on his bed, feels himself refreshed by
some word of consolation, so those souls feel themselves
consoled in hearing only her name.<a id="FNanchor_705" href="#Footnote_705" class="fnanchor">[705]</a> The name
alone of Mary, a name of hope and salvation, which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>[270]</span>
these beloved children often invoke in that prison, is
for them a great comfort. But, then, says Novarino,
the loving mother, on hearing herself invoked by them,
adds her prayers to God, by which these souls receive
comfort, and find their burning pains cooled as if by
dew from heaven.<a id="FNanchor_706" href="#Footnote_706" class="fnanchor">[706]</a></p>

<p>But not only does Mary console and succor her
servants in purgatory; she also releases them from
this prison, and delivers them by her intercession.
From the day of her glorious assumption, in which
that prison is said to have been emptied,<a id="FNanchor_707" href="#Footnote_707" class="fnanchor">[707]</a> as Gerson
writes; and Novarino confirms this by saying, that
many weighty authors relate that Mary, when about
to ascend to paradise, asked this favor of her Son,
that she might take with her all the souls that were
then in purgatory;<a id="FNanchor_708" href="#Footnote_708" class="fnanchor">[708]</a> from that time, says Gerson, the
blessed Virgin has possessed the privilege of freeing her
servants from those pains. And this also is positively
asserted by St. Bernardine, who says that the blessed
Virgin has the power of delivering souls from purgatory
by her prayers and the application of her merits,
especially if they have been devoted to her.<a id="FNanchor_709" href="#Footnote_709" class="fnanchor">[709]</a> And<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>[271]</span>
Novarino says the same thing, believing that by the
merits of Mary, not only the torments of these souls
are assuaged, but also abridged, the time of their purgation
being shortened by her intercession:<a id="FNanchor_710" href="#Footnote_710" class="fnanchor">[710]</a> and for
this it is enough that she presents herself to pray for
them.</p>

<p>St. Peter Damian relates,<a id="FNanchor_711" href="#Footnote_711" class="fnanchor">[711]</a> that a certain lady,
named Marozia, after death, appeared to her godmother,
and told her that on the day of the Assumption
of Mary she had been released by her from purgatory,
with a multitude of souls exceeding in number
the whole population of Rome. St. Denis the
Carthusian relates, that on the festivals of the birth
and resurrection of Jesus Christ, Mary descends into
purgatory, accompanied by troops of angels, and releases
many souls from their torments.<a id="FNanchor_712" href="#Footnote_712" class="fnanchor">[712]</a> And Novarino
believes that the same thing happens on every
solemn festival of the holy Virgin.<a id="FNanchor_713" href="#Footnote_713" class="fnanchor">[713]</a></p>

<p>Every one has heard of the promise made by Mary
to Pope John, to whom she appeared, and ordered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"></a>[272]</span>
him to make known to all those who should wear the
sacred scapular of Carmel, that on the Saturday after
their death they should be released from purgatory.
And this was proclaimed by the same pontiff, as
Father Crasset relates,<a id="FNanchor_714" href="#Footnote_714" class="fnanchor">[714]</a> in a bull which he published.
It was also confirmed by Alexander V., Clement VII.,
Pius V., Gregory XIII., and Paul V., who, in 1612,
in a bull said: “That Christians may piously believe
that the blessed Virgin will aid by her continual intercession,
by her merits and special protection, after
death, and principally on Saturday, which is a day
consecrated by the Church to the blessed Virgin, the
souls of the members of the confraternity of holy
Mary of Mount Carmel, who shall have departed this
life in the state of grace, worn the scapular, observing
chastity according to their state of life, recited the
office of the Virgin, and if they have not been able
to recite it, shall have observed the fasts of the Church,
abstaining from flesh-meat on Wednesdays, except on
Christmas-day.” And in the solemn office of the
feast of holy Mary of Mount Carmel, we read that it
is piously believed, that the holy Virgin, with a
mother’s love, consoles the members of the confraternity
of Mount Carmel in purgatory, and by her intercession
conducts them to their heavenly country.<a id="FNanchor_715" href="#Footnote_715" class="fnanchor">[715]</a></p>

<p>Why should we not also hope for the same graces<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273"></a>[273]</span>
and favors, if we are devoted to this good mother?
And if with more special love we serve her, why cannot
we hope to obtain the grace of going immediately after
death to paradise, without entering into purgatory?
as we read that the holy Virgin said to the blessed
Godfrey, through brother Abondo, in these words:
“Go and tell brother Godfrey to advance in virtue, for
thus he will be a child of my Son, and mine also; and
when his soul quits the body, I will not permit it to
go to purgatory, but I will take it and present it to
my Son.”<a id="FNanchor_716" href="#Footnote_716" class="fnanchor">[716]</a> And if we would assist the holy souls in
purgatory, let us endeavor to remember them in all
our prayers to the blessed Virgin, applying to them
especially the holy rosary, which procures for them
great relief, as we read in the following example.</p>

<h5>EXAMPLE.</h5>

<p>Father Eusebius Nierembergh relates,<a id="FNanchor_717" href="#Footnote_717" class="fnanchor">[717]</a> that there
lived in the city of Aragona a girl, named Alexandra,
who, being noble and very beautiful, was greatly
loved by two young men. Through jealousy, they
one day fought and killed each other. Their enraged
relatives, in return, killed the poor young girl, as the
cause of so much trouble, cut off her head, and threw
her into a well. A few days after, St. Dominic was
passing through that place, and, inspired by the Lord,
approached the well, and said: “Alexandra, come
forth,” and immediately the head of the deceased<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>[274]</span>
came forth, placed itself on the edge of the well, and
prayed St. Dominic to hear its confession. The saint
heard its confession, and also gave it communion, in
presence of a great concourse of persons who had assembled
to witness the miracle. Then, St. Dominic
ordered her to speak and tell why she had received
that grace. Alexandra answered, that when she was
beheaded, she was in a state of mortal sin, but that
the most holy Mary, on account of the rosary, which
she was in the habit of reciting, had preserved her in
life. Two days the head retained its life upon the
edge of the well, in the presence of all, and then the
soul went to purgatory. But fifteen days after, the
soul of Alexandra appeared to St. Dominic, beautiful
and radiant as a star, and told him, that one of the
principal sources of relief to the souls in purgatory
is the rosary which is recited for them; and that,
as soon as they arrive in paradise, they pray for
those who apply to them these powerful prayers.
Having said this, St. Dominic saw that happy
soul ascending in triumph to the kingdom of the
blessed.</p>

<h5>PRAYER.</h5>

<p>Oh Queen of heaven and of earth, oh mother of the
Lord of the world, oh Mary, creature most great,
most exalted, most amiable, it is true that many on the
earth do not love thee and do not know thee; but there
are innumerable angels and saints in heaven who love
and praise thee continually. On this earth, too, how<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275"></a>[275]</span>
many happy souls burn with love of thee, and live
enamored of thy goodness! Ah, if I, too, might love
thee, my most lovely Lady! Oh, that I might always
be engaged in serving thee, in praising thee, in honoring
thee, and in striving to awaken love of thee in
others. A God hath been enamored of thee, who, by
thy beauty, if I may so speak, hast drawn him from
the bosom of the eternal Father, to come upon the
earth and become man and thy Son; and I, a miserable
worm, shall I not be enamored of thee? Yes, my
most sweet mother, I also will love thee, love thee
much, and do all in my power to make thee loved by
others. Accept, then, oh Mary, the desire I have to
love thee, and help me to fulfil it: I know that thy
lovers are regarded with much favor by thy God.
Next to his own glory, he desires nothing more than
thy glory, in seeing thee honored and loved by all.
From thee, oh Lady, I await all my blessings. Thou
must obtain the pardon of all my sins, thou must
obtain for me perseverance, succor in death, deliverance
from purgatory, in a word, thou must conduct
me to paradise. All this thy lovers hope from thee,
and they are not deceived. This I also hope, who
love thee with all my heart, and above all things
next to God.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>[276]</span></p>

<h4 id="CHAPTER_VIII_SECTION_III">SECTION III.<br>
MARY CONDUCTS HER SERVANTS TO PARADISE.</h4>

<p>Oh, what a signal mark of predestination have
the servants of Mary! The holy Church applies to
this divine mother the words of Ecclesiasticus, and
makes her say for the comfort of her servants: “In
all these I sought rest, and I shall abide in the inheritance
of the Lord.”<a id="FNanchor_718" href="#Footnote_718" class="fnanchor">[718]</a> Cardinal Hugo, commenting on
this, remarks: Blessed is he in whose habitation the
holy Virgin found rest: “Beatus in cujus domo beatæ
Virgo requiem invenerit.” Mary, through the love
she bears to all, seeks to make devotion to her prevail
in all hearts. Many do not receive it, or do not preserve
it; blessed is he who receives it and preserves
it. In the inheritance of the Lord will I abide; that
is, adds the learned Paciucchelli, in those who are the
inheritance of the Lord.<a id="FNanchor_719" href="#Footnote_719" class="fnanchor">[719]</a> Devotion to the Virgin
abides in all those who are the inheritance of the Lord,
that is, who will be in heaven praising him eternally.
Mary continues in the passage above cited: “He that
made me, rested in my tabernacle, and he said to me:
Let thy dwelling be in Jacob, and thy inheritance in
Israel, and take root in my elect.”<a id="FNanchor_720" href="#Footnote_720" class="fnanchor">[720]</a> My Creator has<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"></a>[277]</span>
condescended to come and rest in my bosom, and has
willed that I should inhabit in the hearts of all the elect,
whom Jacob prefigured, and who are the inheritance
of the Virgin; and he has ordained that devotion to
me and confidence in me should take root in the
hearts of the elect.</p>

<p>Oh, how many would have failed of being among
the blessed in heaven, if Mary, by her powerful intercession,
had not conducted them thither! “I made
that in the heavens there should rise light that never
faileth;”<a id="FNanchor_721" href="#Footnote_721" class="fnanchor">[721]</a> thus Cardinal Hugo puts into her mouth
these words of the same chapter of Ecclesiasticus: I
have made to shine in heaven as many eternal lights
as I have devoted servants. Whence the same author
adds, commenting on this text: Many saints are in
heaven by her intercession, who never would have
been there without it.<a id="FNanchor_722" href="#Footnote_722" class="fnanchor">[722]</a> St. Bonaventure says, that
the gate of heaven will be opened to receive all those
who trust in the protection of Mary.<a id="FNanchor_723" href="#Footnote_723" class="fnanchor">[723]</a> Hence St.
Ephrem called devotion to the divine mother the
opening of paradise.<a id="FNanchor_724" href="#Footnote_724" class="fnanchor">[724]</a> And the devout Blosius, addressing
the Virgin, says to her: Lady, to thee are
committed the keys and the treasures of the heavenly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>[278]</span>
kingdom.<a id="FNanchor_725" href="#Footnote_725" class="fnanchor">[725]</a> And, therefore, we should continually
supplicate her in the words of St. Ambrose: Open to
us, oh Virgin, heaven, for thou hast the keys of it.<a id="FNanchor_726" href="#Footnote_726" class="fnanchor">[726]</a>
Nay, thou art even the gate of it, as the holy Church
names thee, “Janua cœli.”</p>

<p>For this reason the great mother is also called by
the holy Church: Star of the sea: “Ave, Maris
stella.” For as navigators, says the angelic St.
Thomas, are guided to port by means of a star, thus
Christians are guided to heaven by means of Mary.<a id="FNanchor_727" href="#Footnote_727" class="fnanchor">[727]</a></p>

<p>She is for this reason, finally, called by St. Peter
Damian, the ladder of heaven: “Scala cœlestis;” for,
as the saint says, by means of Mary God has descended
from heaven to earth, that by the same, or by
her, men might merit to ascend from earth to heaven.<a id="FNanchor_728" href="#Footnote_728" class="fnanchor">[728]</a>
And for this reason, oh Lady, says St. Anastasius, thou
art full of grace, that thou mightest be made the
way of our salvation, and the ascent to the celestial
country.<a id="FNanchor_729" href="#Footnote_729" class="fnanchor">[729]</a> St. Bernard calls the blessed Virgin:
The vehicle to heaven: “Vehiculum ad cœlum.”
And St. John the Geometrician salutes her: Hail,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"></a>[279]</span>
most noble chariot: “Salve clarissime currus;” by
which her servants are conducted to heaven. And,
St. Bonaventure addresses her thus: Blessed are those
who know thee, oh mother of God! for to know thee
is the path to immortal life, and to publish thy virtues
is the way to eternal salvation.<a id="FNanchor_730" href="#Footnote_730" class="fnanchor">[730]</a></p>

<p>In the Franciscan chronicles<a id="FNanchor_731" href="#Footnote_731" class="fnanchor">[731]</a> it is related of brother
Leo, that he once saw a red ladder, upon which Jesus
Christ was standing, and a white one, upon which
stood his holy mother. He saw persons attempting
to ascend the red ladder; they ascended a few steps
and then fell; they ascended again, and again fell.
Then they were exhorted to ascend the white ladder,
and on that he saw them succeed, for the blessed
Virgin offered them her hand, and they arrived in
that manner safe in paradise. St. Denis the Carthusian
asks: Who will ever be saved? Who will ever
reign in heaven? They are saved, and will certainly
reign, he himself answers, for whom this queen of
mercy offers her prayers.<a id="FNanchor_732" href="#Footnote_732" class="fnanchor">[732]</a> And this Mary herself
affirms: By me kings reign: “Per me reges regnant.”<a id="FNanchor_733" href="#Footnote_733" class="fnanchor">[733]</a>
Through my intercession souls reign first
in the mortal life on this earth, by governing their
passions, and then they go to reign eternally in
heaven, where, as St. Augustine declares, all are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280"></a>[280]</span>
kings: “Quot cives, tot reges.” Mary, in a word, as
Richard of St. Laurence says, is the mistress of paradise,
since there she commands according to her pleasure,
and introduces into it whom she will. Therefore,
applying to her the words of Ecclesiasticus, he adds:
“My power is in Jerusalem:”<a id="FNanchor_734" href="#Footnote_734" class="fnanchor">[734]</a> I command what I will,
and introduce whom I will.<a id="FNanchor_735" href="#Footnote_735" class="fnanchor">[735]</a> And as she is the mother
of the Lord of paradise, she is with reason, also, says
Rupert, the Lady of paradise. She possesses, by right,
the whole kingdom of her Son.<a id="FNanchor_736" href="#Footnote_736" class="fnanchor">[736]</a></p>

<p>This divine mother, with her powerful prayers and
assistance, has obtained for us paradise, if we place no
obstacle to our entrance there.<a id="FNanchor_737" href="#Footnote_737" class="fnanchor">[737]</a> Wherefore those
who are servants of Mary, and for whom Mary intercedes,
are as secure of paradise as if they were already
there.<a id="FNanchor_738" href="#Footnote_738" class="fnanchor">[738]</a> To serve Mary and to belong to her
court, adds St. John of Damascus, is the greatest
honor we can attain; for to serve the queen of heaven
is to reign already in heaven, and to live in obedience
to her commands is more than to reign.<a id="FNanchor_739" href="#Footnote_739" class="fnanchor">[739]</a> On the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281"></a>[281]</span>
other hand, he says that those who do not serve Mary
will not be saved; whilst those who are deprived
of the support of this great mother, are deprived of
the succor of the Son, and of all the celestial court.<a id="FNanchor_740" href="#Footnote_740" class="fnanchor">[740]</a></p>

<p>Forever praised be the infinite goodness of our God
who has constituted Mary our advocate in heaven,
that she, as mother of the judge and mother of mercy
may efficaciously, by her intercession, order the great
affair of our eternal salvation. This sentiment is taken
from St. Bernard.<a id="FNanchor_741" href="#Footnote_741" class="fnanchor">[741]</a> And James the Monk, esteemed
a doctor among the Greek fathers, says that God has
made Mary a bridge of salvation, by which we are
enabled to pass over the waves of this world, and
reach the blessed port of paradise.<a id="FNanchor_742" href="#Footnote_742" class="fnanchor">[742]</a> Hence St. Bonaventure
exclaims: Hear, oh ye people who desire
paradise; serve and honor Mary, and you will certainly
find life eternal.<a id="FNanchor_743" href="#Footnote_743" class="fnanchor">[743]</a></p>

<p>Not even those who deserve hell should despair of
attaining the kingdom of the blessed, if they faithfully
devote themselves to the service of this queen. Sinners,
says St. Germanus, have sought to find God by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282"></a>[282]</span>
thy means, oh Mary, and have been saved!<a id="FNanchor_744" href="#Footnote_744" class="fnanchor">[744]</a> Richard
of St. Laurence remarks that Mary is said by St. John
to be crowned with stars.<a id="FNanchor_745" href="#Footnote_745" class="fnanchor">[745]</a> On the other hand, in
the sacred Canticles, the Virgin is said to be crowned
with wild beasts, lions and panthers: “Come from
Libanus, my spouse, come from Libanus, come; thou
shalt be crowned from the dens of the lions, from the
mountains of the leopards.”<a id="FNanchor_746" href="#Footnote_746" class="fnanchor">[746]</a> What does this signify?
Richard answers that those wild beasts are those sinners,
who, through the favor and intercession of Mary, have
become stars of paradise, which are a crown more
worthy of this queen of mercy, than all the material
stars of heaven.<a id="FNanchor_747" href="#Footnote_747" class="fnanchor">[747]</a> The servant of the Lord, sister
Seraphina da Capri, as we read in her life, in her
prayers to the most holy Virgin during the Novena of
her assumption, asked of her the conversion of a thousand
sinners; but as she feared that her demands
were too extravagant, the Virgin appeared to her, and
reproved her for this her vain fear, saying to her:
“Why do you fear? am I not powerful enough to
obtain for thee from my Son the salvation of a thousand
sinners? Behold them, I have already obtained
it.” She then led her in spirit to paradise, and there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283"></a>[283]</span>
showed her the souls of innumerable sinners who had
merited hell, and had afterwards been saved by her
intercession, and were already enjoying eternal bliss.</p>

<p>It is true that in this life no one can be certain of
his eternal salvation: “Man knoweth not whether he
be worthy of love or hatred, but all things are kept
uncertain for the time to come.”<a id="FNanchor_748" href="#Footnote_748" class="fnanchor">[748]</a> David asked of
God: Oh Lord, who will be saved? “Who shall
dwell in thy tabernacle?”<a id="FNanchor_749" href="#Footnote_749" class="fnanchor">[749]</a> St. Bonaventure, writing
on these words, answers: Oh sinners, let us follow the
footsteps of Mary, and cast ourselves at her blessed
feet, and let us not leave her until she blesses us, for
her blessing will secure to us paradise.<a id="FNanchor_750" href="#Footnote_750" class="fnanchor">[750]</a> It is enough,
oh Lady, says St. Anselm, that thou dost wish to save
us, for then we cannot but be saved.<a id="FNanchor_751" href="#Footnote_751" class="fnanchor">[751]</a> St. Antoninus
adds, that souls protected by Mary are necessarily
saved; those upon whom she turns her eyes are necessarily
justified and glorified.<a id="FNanchor_752" href="#Footnote_752" class="fnanchor">[752]</a></p>

<p>With reason, says St. Ildephonsus, the most holy Virgin
predicted that all generations would call her blessed;<a id="FNanchor_753" href="#Footnote_753" class="fnanchor">[753]</a>
for all the elect by means of Mary obtain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284"></a>[284]</span>
eternal blessedness.<a id="FNanchor_754" href="#Footnote_754" class="fnanchor">[754]</a> Thou, oh great mother, art the
beginning, the middle, and the end of our felicity,
says St. Methodius.<a id="FNanchor_755" href="#Footnote_755" class="fnanchor">[755]</a> The beginning, because Mary
obtains for us the pardon of our sins; the middle, because
she obtains for us perseverance in divine grace;
the end, because she finally obtains for us paradise.
By thee, St. Bernard continues, heaven has been
opened—by thee hell has been emptied—by thee paradise
has been restored—by thee, in a word, eternal
life has been given to many sinners who have merited
eternal death.<a id="FNanchor_756" href="#Footnote_756" class="fnanchor">[756]</a></p>

<p>But above all, we should be encouraged in the certain
hope of paradise, by the rich promise which
Mary has herself made to those who honor her, and
especially to those who, by their words and their example,
strive to make her known and honored among
others: “They that work by me shall not sin; they
that explain me shall have life everlasting.”<a id="FNanchor_757" href="#Footnote_757" class="fnanchor">[757]</a> Oh
happy, then, are they, says St. Bonaventure, who gain
the favor of Mary! they will be welcomed by the
blessed as being already their companions; and whosoever
bears the seal of a servant of Mary, has his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285"></a>[285]</span>
name already written in the book of life.<a id="FNanchor_758" href="#Footnote_758" class="fnanchor">[758]</a> Of what
avail is it, then, to trouble ourselves with the opinions
of the schoolmen, on the question, whether predestination
to glory precedes or follows the foreknowledge
of merits? Whether or not our names are written in
the book of life? If we are true servants of Mary
and obtain her protection, we certainly are written
there; for, as St. John of Damascus says, God gives
the grace of devotion to his holy mother only to those
whom he will save; in conformity with this, as the
Lord seems to have declared expressly through St.
John: “He that shall overcome, I will write upon him
the name of my God, and the name of the city of my
God.”<a id="FNanchor_759" href="#Footnote_759" class="fnanchor">[759]</a> And who is this city of God but Mary? as
St. Gregory explains, commenting on this passage of
David: “Glorious things are said of thee, oh city of
God.”<a id="FNanchor_760" href="#Footnote_760" class="fnanchor">[760]</a></p>

<p>We may, then, well say with St. Paul: “Having
this seal, the Lord knoweth who are his.”<a id="FNanchor_761" href="#Footnote_761" class="fnanchor">[761]</a> Whosoever
carries the seal of a servant of Mary, is acknowledged
by God as his own. We read in St.
Bernard, that devotion to the mother of God is the
most certain sign that we shall obtain eternal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286"></a>[286]</span>
salvation.<a id="FNanchor_762" href="#Footnote_762" class="fnanchor">[762]</a> And the blessed Alanus, speaking of the
“Hail Mary,” says that he who often invokes the
Virgin with this angelical salutation, has a very certain
sign of predestination.<a id="FNanchor_763" href="#Footnote_763" class="fnanchor">[763]</a> And again he says of
perseverance in the daily recitation of the holy rosary:
Let it be to thee a most probable sign of eternal
salvation, if thou dost perseveringly honor the blessed
Virgin by daily reciting her rosary.<a id="FNanchor_764" href="#Footnote_764" class="fnanchor">[764]</a> Father Nierembergh
still further remarks, that the servants of the
mother of God not only are more privileged and favored
in this world, but also in heaven will be more
especially honored. And he adds, that in heaven
they will have a peculiarly rich device and livery, by
which they will be known as servants of the queen of
heaven and as the people of her court, according to
those words of Proverbs: “All her domestics are
clothed with double garments.”<a id="FNanchor_765" href="#Footnote_765" class="fnanchor">[765]</a></p>

<p>St. Mary Magdalen of Pazzi saw a small vessel in
the midst of the sea, in which all the servants of Mary
had taken shelter; she herself steering it, safely conducted
them to port. By this the saint understood
that they who live under the protection of Mary, are
rescued, in the midst of all the dangers of this life,
from the shipwreck of sin, and from damnation, for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287"></a>[287]</span>
by her they are guided in safety to the port of paradise.
Let us, then, strive to enter this blessed little
vessel of the mantle of Mary, and there let us dwell
secure of the kingdom of heaven; for the Church
sings, “Holy mother of God, all those who are to be
partakers of eternal joy dwell with thee, and live
under thy protection.”<a id="FNanchor_766" href="#Footnote_766" class="fnanchor">[766]</a></p>

<h5>EXAMPLE.</h5>

<p>Cesarius relates,<a id="FNanchor_767" href="#Footnote_767" class="fnanchor">[767]</a> that a certain Cistercian monk, who
was a devoted servant of our blessed Lady, desired
very earnestly a visit from his dear Lady, and was
praying her continually to grant him this favor. He
went one night into the garden, and while he stood
there looking up to heaven, breathing forth to his
queen in ardent sighs his desire to see her, a beautiful
and radiant virgin descended, and said to him:
“Thomas, wouldst thou like to hear me sing?”
“Certainly,” he answered; and then she sang so
sweetly that it seemed to the devout religious that he
was in paradise. Having finished her song, she disappeared,
leaving him absorbed with an ardent desire
to know who it could have been; and, soon after,
another extremely beautiful virgin appeared to him,
who, like the first, allowed him the pleasure of hearing
her sing. He could not refrain from asking
this one who she was, and the virgin answered:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288"></a>[288]</span>
“She whom you saw a little while ago was Catherine,
and I am Agnes, both martyrs for Jesus Christ, sent
by our Lady to console you. Give thanks to Mary,
and prepare for a greater favor.” Having said this
she disappeared, but left the religious with a greater
hope of finally seeing his queen. Nor was he deceived,
for shortly after he saw a great light and felt a new
joy flowing into his heart, for in the midst of that
light the mother of God appeared to him surrounded
by angels, and of a beauty far surpassing that of the
other two saints who had appeared to him. She said
to him: “My dear servant and son, I have been
pleased with the devotion which you have offered me,
and have graciously heard your prayers: you have
desired to see me; look on me, and I will also sing to
you.” Then the most holy Virgin began to sing with
so great sweetness, that the devout religious lost his
senses, and fell with his face upon the ground. The
matin-bell sounded, the monks assembled, and not
seeing Thomas, searched for him in his cell and other
parts of the convent, and at last going into the garden
they found him there, apparently lifeless. The superior
commanded him to tell what had befallen him.
And coming to himself, by the power of obedience,
he related all the favors which the divine mother had
bestowed upon him.</p>

<h5>PRAYER.</h5>

<p>Oh queen of paradise! mother of holy love! for
thou art of all creatures the most lovely, the most<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289"></a>[289]</span>
beloved of God and his first lover; ah, suffer the vilest
and most ungrateful sinner on the earth to love thee,
who sees himself released from hell by thy intercession,
and without any merit of his own so blessed
by thee, that he is enamored of thy goodness. I
would wish, if I could, to make known to all men who
do not know thee, how worthy thou art to be loved,
that all might love and honor thee. I would willingly
die for love of thee, in defending thy virginity, thy
dignity as mother of God, and thy immaculate conception;
if it were ever needful for me to die in defence
of these thy great privileges. Oh my most
beloved mother, graciously accept this my affection,
and do not permit that one of thy servants, who loves
thee, should ever become an enemy of thy God, whom
thou lovest so much. Ah, unhappy me, such once
was I when I offended my Lord. But then, oh Mary,
I did not love thee, and I sought little to be loved by
thee. Now, after the grace of God, I desire nothing
else than to love thee, and to be loved by thee. I
do not despair of this on account of my past offences,
for I know that thou, oh most benign and grateful
Lady, dost not disdain to love even the most miserable
sinners who love thee, and never dost allow
thyself to be outdone in love by any one. Oh most
lovely queen, I wish to go to thee in paradise, there
to love thee. There, at thy feet, I shall better know
how amiable thou art, and how much thou hast done
to save me; therefore I shall love thee there with
greater love, and shall love thee eternally, without the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290"></a>[290]</span>
fear that I shall ever cease to love thee. Oh Mary,
I have the certain hope of being saved through thee.
Pray to Jesus for me. I have no other wish. It is
thine to save me; thou art my hope. I will always
exclaim, Oh Mary, my hope, thou must save me.</p>

</div>

<h4 id="CHAPTER_IX_SECTION_I">HOW GREAT IS THE CLEMENCY AND MERCY OF MARY.</h4>

<p>St. Bernard, speaking of the great mercy of Mary
for us poor sinners, says that she is the very Land
promised by God, flowing with milk and honey.<a id="FNanchor_768" href="#Footnote_768" class="fnanchor">[768]</a>
St. Leo says, that to the Virgin has been given
such bowels of compassion, that she not only merits
to be called merciful, but should be called mercy
itself.<a id="FNanchor_769" href="#Footnote_769" class="fnanchor">[769]</a> And St. Bonaventure, considering that Mary
was made the mother of God for the sake of us
sinners, and that to her was committed the charge
of dispensing mercies; and considering, moreover, the
great care she has for all those in misery, which renders
her so rich in compassion, that she appears to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291"></a>[291]</span>
desire nothing else than to relieve the necessitous,
says, that when he looked on Mary, it seemed to him
that he no longer beheld the divine justice, but only
the divine mercy, with which Mary is filled.<a id="FNanchor_770" href="#Footnote_770" class="fnanchor">[770]</a></p>

<p>In a word, the mercy of Mary is so great, that as
Guerric the Abbot says: Her bowels of love can
never for a moment cease to bring forth for us the
fruits of mercy.<a id="FNanchor_771" href="#Footnote_771" class="fnanchor">[771]</a> And what, exclaims St. Bernard,
can flow but mercy from a fountain of mercy? “Quid
de fonte pietatis nisi pietas?”<a id="FNanchor_772" href="#Footnote_772" class="fnanchor">[772]</a> For this reason Mary
was called the olive-tree: As a fair olive-tree in the
plains: “Quasi oliva speciosa in campis.”<a id="FNanchor_773" href="#Footnote_773" class="fnanchor">[773]</a> For, as
the olive-tree produces nothing but oil, the symbol
of mercy, thus from the hands of Mary nothing but
graces and mercies proceed. Hence, justly, says the
venerable Louis da Ponte, is Mary called the mother
of oil, since she is the mother of mercy.<a id="FNanchor_774" href="#Footnote_774" class="fnanchor">[774]</a> If, then,
we have recourse to this mother, and ask of her the
oil of her mercy, we cannot fear that she will refuse
us, as the wise virgins refused the foolish, answering:
“Lest there be not enough for us and for you.”<a id="FNanchor_775" href="#Footnote_775" class="fnanchor">[775]</a> No,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292"></a>[292]</span>
for she is, indeed, rich in that oil of mercy, as St.
Bonaventure remarks: Mary abounds in the oil of
mercy: “Maria plena oleo pietatis.”<a id="FNanchor_776" href="#Footnote_776" class="fnanchor">[776]</a> She is called
by the Church not only prudent, but most prudent,
and by this we may understand, as Hugo of St.
Victor says, that Mary is so full of grace and mercy
that there is enough for all without exhausting
her.<a id="FNanchor_777" href="#Footnote_777" class="fnanchor">[777]</a></p>

<p>But why, I would ask, is it said that this fair olive
is in the midst of the plains, and not rather in a garden
surrounded by walls and hedges? Cardinal Hugo
answers to this question: In order that all may easily
see her, and thus may easily have recourse to her, to
obtain relief for their necessities.<a id="FNanchor_778" href="#Footnote_778" class="fnanchor">[778]</a> St. Antoninus
confirms this beautiful thought, when he says: That
as all can go and gather the fruit of an olive-tree that
is exposed in the open fields, so all, both the just and
sinners, can have recourse to Mary to obtain mercy.<a id="FNanchor_779" href="#Footnote_779" class="fnanchor">[779]</a>
And then the saint adds: Oh how many sentences of
punishment have been revoked through the merciful
prayers of this most holy Virgin, in favor of sinners<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293"></a>[293]</span>
who have had recourse to her!<a id="FNanchor_780" href="#Footnote_780" class="fnanchor">[780]</a> And what more secure
refuge can we find, says the devout Thomas à Kempis,
than the compassionate heart of Mary? There the
poor find shelter; the sick medicine; the afflicted consolation;
the doubtful counsel; the abandoned help.<a id="FNanchor_781" href="#Footnote_781" class="fnanchor">[781]</a></p>

<p>Wretched should we be, if we had not this mother
of mercy, mindful and solicitous to help us in our
miseries! “Where there is no wife,” says the Holy
Spirit, “he mourneth that is in want.”<a id="FNanchor_782" href="#Footnote_782" class="fnanchor">[782]</a> This wife, remarks
St. John Damascene, is certainly Mary, without
whom the sick man suffers and mourns.<a id="FNanchor_783" href="#Footnote_783" class="fnanchor">[783]</a> So, indeed,
it is, since God has ordained that all graces should
be dispensed by the prayers of Mary: where these
are wanting, there is no hope of mercy, as our Lord
signified to St. Bridget, saying to her: “Unless
Mary interposes by her prayers, there is no hope of
mercy.”<a id="FNanchor_784" href="#Footnote_784" class="fnanchor">[784]</a></p>

<p>But perhaps we fear that Mary does not see or pity
our miseries. Oh, no! she sees them and feels them
more than we do ourselves. And who among the
saints can be found, says St. Antoninus, who pities us<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294"></a>[294]</span>
in our miseries as Mary does?<a id="FNanchor_785" href="#Footnote_785" class="fnanchor">[785]</a> Hence, wherever she
sees misery she cannot refrain from hastening to relieve
it with her great compassion.<a id="FNanchor_786" href="#Footnote_786" class="fnanchor">[786]</a> Thus Richard of
St. Victor remarks, and Mendoza confirms it by saying:
Therefore, oh blessed Virgin, wherever thou seest misery,
there thou dost pour forth thy mercies.<a id="FNanchor_787" href="#Footnote_787" class="fnanchor">[787]</a> And our
good mother, as she herself declares, will never cease
to exercise this office of mercy: And unto the world to
come I shall not cease to be; and in the holy dwelling-place,
I have ministered before him.<a id="FNanchor_788" href="#Footnote_788" class="fnanchor">[788]</a> Upon which
words Cardinal Hugo remarks: I will not cease, says
Mary, even to the end of the world, to succor men in
their miseries, and to pray for sinners, that they may
be saved and rescued from eternal misery.<a id="FNanchor_789" href="#Footnote_789" class="fnanchor">[789]</a></p>

<p>Suetonius relates of the Emperor Titus, that he was
so desirous to grant favors to those who asked them
of him, that on those days when he had no opportunity
of doing so, he would say, sorrowfully, I have lost a
day: “Diem perdidi.” This day has been lost to
me, because I have passed it without benefiting any
one. Probably Titus said this more through vanity,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295"></a>[295]</span>
or a desire for esteem, than through a movement of
charity. But our Empress Mary, if a day should ever
pass in which she did not confer some favor, would
say it only because she is full of charity, and of a
desire to do us good; for as Bernardine de Bustis says,
she is more desirous to confer favors on us, than we
are to receive them from her.<a id="FNanchor_790" href="#Footnote_790" class="fnanchor">[790]</a> And this same author
adds, that when we have recourse to her, we
shall always find her with her hands full of mercy and
liberality.<a id="FNanchor_791" href="#Footnote_791" class="fnanchor">[791]</a></p>

<p>Rebecca was the type of Mary, who, when the
servant of Abraham asked her for a little water, answered
that she would give him water enough not
only for himself, but for his camels also.<a id="FNanchor_792" href="#Footnote_792" class="fnanchor">[792]</a> Hence
the devout St. Bernard, addressing the blessed Virgin,
says: Oh Lady, not to the servant of Abraham only,
but also to his camels give from thy overflowing
pitcher.<a id="FNanchor_793" href="#Footnote_793" class="fnanchor">[793]</a> By which he intends to say: Oh Lady,
thou art merciful and more liberal than Rebecca,
therefore thou dost not rest contented with dispensing
the favors of thy unbounded compassion to the servants
of Abraham alone, by whom are meant the faithful
servants of God, but thou dost bestow them also on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296"></a>[296]</span>
the camels, who represent sinners. And, as Rebecca
gave more than she was asked, so Mary bestows more
than we pray for. The liberality of Mary, says Richard
of St. Laurence, resembles the liberality of her
Son, who always gives more than is asked, and is
therefore named by St. Paul: “Rich to all that call
upon him;”<a id="FNanchor_794" href="#Footnote_794" class="fnanchor">[794]</a> that is, giving abundantly his graces to
all those that have recourse to him with their prayers.
Hear the words of Richard: The bounty of Mary is
like the bounty of her Son; she gives more than is
asked.<a id="FNanchor_795" href="#Footnote_795" class="fnanchor">[795]</a> Hence a devout author, addressing the Virgin,
says: Oh Lady, pray for me, for thou wilt ask favors
for me with greater devotion than I can do; and thou
wilt obtain from God graces greater by far than I can
pray for.<a id="FNanchor_796" href="#Footnote_796" class="fnanchor">[796]</a></p>

<p>When the Samaritans refused to receive Jesus Christ
and his doctrine, St. James and St. John said to their
Master: “Lord, wilt thou that we command fire to come
down from heaven and consume them?” But the Saviour
answered: “You know not of what spirit you
are.”<a id="FNanchor_797" href="#Footnote_797" class="fnanchor">[797]</a> As if he had said: I am of so mild and
merciful a spirit, that I have come from heaven to
save, not to punish sinners, and would you wish to see
them lost? What fire? What punishment? Be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297"></a>[297]</span>
silent, speak to me no more of punishment, that is not
my spirit. But we cannot doubt that Mary, whose
spirit is in every thing so like that of her Son, is wholly
inclined to exercise mercy; for, as she told St. Bridget,
she is called the mother of mercy, and the mercy of
God itself has made her so compassionate and sweet
towards all.<a id="FNanchor_798" href="#Footnote_798" class="fnanchor">[798]</a> Wherefore Mary was seen by St. John
clothed with the sun: “And there appeared a great
wonder in heaven, a woman clothed with the sun.”<a id="FNanchor_799" href="#Footnote_799" class="fnanchor">[799]</a>
Upon which passage St. Bernard remarks, addressing
the Virgin: Thou hast clothed the sun, and art
thyself clothed with it.<a id="FNanchor_800" href="#Footnote_800" class="fnanchor">[800]</a> Oh Lady, thou hast clothed
the sun, the divine Word, with human flesh, but he
hath clothed thee with his power and his mercy.</p>

<p>So compassionate, then, and kind is this queen, says
St. Bernard, that when a sinner recommends himself
to her mercy, she does not begin to examine his
merits, and whether he is worthy or not of being
heard, but she graciously hears all and succors them.<a id="FNanchor_801" href="#Footnote_801" class="fnanchor">[801]</a>
Hence St. Idelbert remarks, that Mary is called fair
as the moon: “Pulchra ut Luna;”<a id="FNanchor_802" href="#Footnote_802" class="fnanchor">[802]</a> because, as
the moon illuminates and benefits the smallest bodies
upon the earth, so Mary enlightens and helps the most<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298"></a>[298]</span>
unworthy sinners.<a id="FNanchor_803" href="#Footnote_803" class="fnanchor">[803]</a> And although the moon receives
all her light from the sun, she moves more quickly
than the sun; for, as a certain author remarks, what
the sun does in a year, the moon does in a month.<a id="FNanchor_804" href="#Footnote_804" class="fnanchor">[804]</a>
Hence, says St. Anselm: Our relief is sometimes more
immediate when the name of Mary is invoked than
when we invoke the name of Jesus.<a id="FNanchor_805" href="#Footnote_805" class="fnanchor">[805]</a> Wherefore
Hugo of St. Victor tells us, that if by reason of our
sins we fear to draw near to God, because he is an infinite
majesty that we have offended, we should not
hesitate to have recourse to Mary, because in her we
shall find nothing to alarm us. She is indeed holy,
immaculate, queen of the world, and mother of God;
but she is of our flesh, and a child of Adam, like ourselves.<a id="FNanchor_806" href="#Footnote_806" class="fnanchor">[806]</a></p>

<p>In a word, says St. Bernard, whatever appertains
to Mary is full of grace and mercy; for she, as mother
of mercy, has become all things to all, and by her
great charity has made herself a debtor to the just and
to sinners, and opens to all the bowels of her compassion,
that all may share it.<a id="FNanchor_807" href="#Footnote_807" class="fnanchor">[807]</a> As “the Devil,” according<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299"></a>[299]</span>
to St. Peter, “goeth about seeking whom he
may devour,”<a id="FNanchor_808" href="#Footnote_808" class="fnanchor">[808]</a> so, on the contrary, says Bernardine de
Bustis, Mary goeth about seeking to whom she can
give life and salvation.<a id="FNanchor_809" href="#Footnote_809" class="fnanchor">[809]</a></p>

<p>We should understand that the protection of Mary, as
St. Germanus says, is greater and more powerful than
we can comprehend.<a id="FNanchor_810" href="#Footnote_810" class="fnanchor">[810]</a> And how is it that the same
Lord, who was under the old law so severe in punishing,
exercises so great mercy towards the greatest sinners?
Thus asks the author del Pomerio;<a id="FNanchor_811" href="#Footnote_811" class="fnanchor">[811]</a> and he also
answers: He does all this for the love and merits of
Mary.<a id="FNanchor_812" href="#Footnote_812" class="fnanchor">[812]</a> Oh, how long since would the world have
been destroyed, says St. Fulgentius, if Mary had not
preserved it by her intercession!<a id="FNanchor_813" href="#Footnote_813" class="fnanchor">[813]</a> But we may with
confidence go to God, as St. Arnold Carnotensis asserts,
and hope for every blessing, now that the Son
is our mediator with the divine Father, and the mother
with the Son. How can it be that the Father will
refuse to hear graciously the Son, when he shows him<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300"></a>[300]</span>
the wounds he has received for sinners? And how
can it be that the Son will not graciously hear the
mother, when she shows him the breasts from which
she has nourished us?<a id="FNanchor_814" href="#Footnote_814" class="fnanchor">[814]</a> St. Peter Chrysologus says
with great energy, that this favored Virgin, having
received God in her womb, demands in return, peace
for the world, salvation for the lost, life for the dead.<a id="FNanchor_815" href="#Footnote_815" class="fnanchor">[815]</a></p>

<p>Oh how many, exclaims the Abbot of Celles, who
merit to be condemned by the divine justice, are saved
by the mercy of Mary! for she is the treasure of God
and the treasurer of all graces; therefore it is that
our salvation is in her hands.<a id="FNanchor_816" href="#Footnote_816" class="fnanchor">[816]</a> Let us always then
have recourse to this mother of mercy, and confidently
hope to be saved by means of her intercession; since
she, as Bernardine de Bustis encourages us to believe,
is our salvation, our life, our hope, our counsel,
our refuge, our help.<a id="FNanchor_817" href="#Footnote_817" class="fnanchor">[817]</a> Mary is that very throne
of grace, says St. Antoninus, to which the apostle
exhorts us to have recourse with confidence, that we
may obtain the divine mercy, with all needed help for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301"></a>[301]</span>
our salvation.<a id="FNanchor_818" href="#Footnote_818" class="fnanchor">[818]</a> To the throne of grace, that is, to
Mary, as St. Antoninus remarks.<a id="FNanchor_819" href="#Footnote_819" class="fnanchor">[819]</a> Hence, Mary was
called by St. Catherine of Sienna: The dispenser of
divine mercy: “Administratrix misericordiæ.”</p>

<p>Let us conclude, then, with the beautiful and sweet
exclamation of St. Bernard upon the words: Oh
clement, oh merciful, oh sweet Virgin Mary: “O
clemens, O pia, O dulcis Virgo Maria.” Oh Mary,
thou art clement to the unhappy, merciful to those
who pray to thee, sweet to those who love thee:
clement to the penitent, merciful to the advancing,
sweet to the perfect. Thou showest thyself clement
by rescuing us from punishment, merciful by bestowing
on us graces, sweet by giving thyself to those who
seek thee.<a id="FNanchor_820" href="#Footnote_820" class="fnanchor">[820]</a></p>

<h5>EXAMPLE.</h5>

<p>Father Charles Bovius relates that in Domans, in
France, lived a married man who had held a criminal
connection with another woman. Now the wife being
unable to endure this, continually besought God to
punish the guilty parties; and one day in particular<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302"></a>[302]</span>
went to an altar of the blessed Virgin, which
was in a certain church, to implore vengeance upon
the woman who had alienated her husband from her;
and this very woman went also every day to the
same altar, to repeat a “Hail Mary.” One night the
divine mother appeared in a dream to the wife, who,
on seeing her, began her accustomed petition: “Justice,
mother of God, justice.” But the blessed Lady
answered: “Justice! do you seek justice from me? Go
and find others to execute justice for you. It belongs
not to me to do it for you. Be it known to you,” she
added, “that this very sinner offers every day a devotion
in my honor, and that I cannot allow any sinner
who does this, to suffer and be punished for his sins.”
The next day the wife went to hear mass in the above-named
church of our Lady, and on coming out met
her husband’s friend; at the sight of her she began
to reproach her and call her a sorceress, who had
even enchanted with her sorceries the blessed Virgin.
“Be silent,” cried the people: “what are you saying?”
“I be silent!” she answered: “what I say is only too
true; this night the Virgin appeared to me; and when
I implored justice of her, she answered me, that she
could not grant it on account of a salutation which
this wicked woman repeats daily in her honor.”
They asked the woman what salutation she repeated
to the mother of God. She answered that it was the
“Hail Mary;” and then on hearing that the blessed
Virgin had dealt with her so mercifully in return for
that trivial act of devotion, she cast herself on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303"></a>[303]</span>
ground before the sacred image, and there, in the
presence of all the people, asked pardon for her scandalous
life, and made a vow of perpetual continence. She
afterwards put on a religious habit, built for herself a
little cell near the church, where she retired, and persevered
in continual penance until the day of her death.</p>

<h5>PRAYER.</h5>

<p>Oh mother of mercy! since thou art so compassionate,
and hast so great a desire to do good to us
sinners, and to satisfy our demands, I, the most
wretched of all men, to-day have recourse to thy
mercy, that thou mayest grant my requests. Let
others ask what they will, health of body, wealth, or
temporal advantages; I come to ask of thee, oh Lady,
those things which thou thyself dost most desire of
me, and which are most conformable and most pleasing
to thy sacred heart. Thou who wast so humble,
obtain for me humility and love of contempt. Thou
who wast so patient in the difficulties of this life, obtain
for me patience in things contrary to my wishes.
Thou who didst overflow with love to God, obtain for
me the gift of a holy and pure love. Thou who wast
all charity towards the neighbor, obtain for me charity
towards all men, and especially towards those who are
my enemies. Thou who wast wholly united to the
divine will, obtain for me a perfect uniformity with the
will of that God in all his dispositions concerning me.
Thou, in a word, art the most holy of all creatures;
oh Mary, obtain for me the grace to become a saint.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304"></a>[304]</span>
Thy love is unfailing; thou canst and wilt obtain all
things for me. Nothing, then, can hinder me from
receiving thy graces but my neglect to invoke thee,
or my want of confidence in thy intercession. But
thou thyself must obtain for me the grace to seek
thee, and this grace of confidence in thy intercession.
These two greatest gifts I ask from thee—from thee
will I receive them—from thee do I confidently hope
for them. Oh Mary! Mary, my mother, my hope, my
love, my life, my refuge, and my consolation. Amen.</p>

<p class="center">Oh sweet Virgin Mary!</p>

</div>

<h4 id="CHAPTER_X_SECTION_I">HOW SWEET IS THE NAME OF MARY IN LIFE AND IN DEATH!</h4>

<p>The great name of Mary, which was given to the
divine mother, was not found on the earth, neither was
it invented by the mind or will of men, as were all
other names that are in use among them; but it came
from heaven, and was given to the Virgin by divine
ordinance, as St. Jerome,<a id="FNanchor_821" href="#Footnote_821" class="fnanchor">[821]</a> St. Epiphanius,<a id="FNanchor_822" href="#Footnote_822" class="fnanchor">[822]</a>
    St. Antoninus,<a id="FNanchor_823" href="#Footnote_823" class="fnanchor">[823]</a>
and others attest. The name of Mary was
drawn from the treasury of the divinity, as Richard
of St. Laurence says:<a id="FNanchor_824" href="#Footnote_824" class="fnanchor">[824]</a> “De thesauro divinitatis Mariæ
nomen evolvitur.” From the treasury of the divinity,
oh Mary, came forth thy excellent and admirable
name; for the Most Holy Trinity, the same author
goes on to say, gave to thee this name, next to the
name of thy Son, so superior to every name, and attached
to it such majesty and power, that when it is
uttered, all in heaven, earth, and hell must fall prostrate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306"></a>[306]</span>
and venerate it.<a id="FNanchor_825" href="#Footnote_825" class="fnanchor">[825]</a> Among all the other privileges
which the Lord has attached to the name of
Mary, let us see how sweet he has made it to the
servants of this most holy Lady in life as well as in
death.</p>

<p>To begin with life, the holy anchorite, Honorius,
says, that the name of Mary is full of all divine sweetness.<a id="FNanchor_826" href="#Footnote_826" class="fnanchor">[826]</a>
And the glorious St. Anthony of Padua attributes
to the name of Mary the same sweetness as
St. Bernard attributed to the name of Jesus. The
name of Jesus, said the latter, the name of Mary, said
the former, is joy to the heart, honey to the mouth,
melody to the ear of their devoted servants.<a id="FNanchor_827" href="#Footnote_827" class="fnanchor">[827]</a> It is
related in the life of the venerable Father John
Ancina, Bishop of Saluzzo, that when he pronounced
the name of Mary, he experienced so great a sensible
sweetness that he even tasted it on his lips. We also
read that a certain woman in Cologne told the Bishop
Marsilius, that whenever she pronounced the name of
Mary she perceived in her mouth a taste sweeter than
honey. Marsilius made the trial, and he also experienced
the same sweetness. We read in the holy
Canticles, that at the Assumption of the Virgin, the
angels three times asked her name: “Who is she that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307"></a>[307]</span>
goeth up by the desert as a pillar of smoke?”<a id="FNanchor_828" href="#Footnote_828" class="fnanchor">[828]</a>
“Who is she that cometh forth as the morning rising?”<a id="FNanchor_829" href="#Footnote_829" class="fnanchor">[829]</a>
And in another: “Who is this that cometh
up from the desert, flowing with delights?”<a id="FNanchor_830" href="#Footnote_830" class="fnanchor">[830]</a> Richard
of St. Laurence inquires why the angels so often
asked the name of this queen, and answers: The
sound of the name of Mary was so sweet to the angels,
and they repeated the question that they might hear
it repeated also.<a id="FNanchor_831" href="#Footnote_831" class="fnanchor">[831]</a></p>

<p>But I do not here speak of this sensible sweetness,
since it is not commonly granted to all, but I speak of
the salutary sweetness of consolation, love, joy, confidence,
and strength, which the name of Mary universally
gives to those who, with devotion, pronounce
it. Speaking on this subject, Francone the Abbot
says, that next to the holy name of Jesus, the name
of Mary is so rich in blessings, that no other name is
uttered on earth or in heaven from which devout souls
receive so much grace, hope, and sweetness.<a id="FNanchor_832" href="#Footnote_832" class="fnanchor">[832]</a> For
the name of Mary, he goes on to say, contains in itself<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_308"></a>[308]</span>
something admirable, sweet, and divine, which, when
it meets a friendly heart, breathes into it an odor of
holy sweetness. And the wonder of this great name
is, he concludes, that if heard a thousand times by the
lovers of Mary, it is always heard as new, the sweetness
they experience in hearing it spoken being always
the same.<a id="FNanchor_833" href="#Footnote_833" class="fnanchor">[833]</a></p>

<p>The blessed Henry Suso, also speaking of this
sweetness, says, that in pronouncing the name of
Mary, he felt his confidence so much increased, and
his love so joyfully enkindled, that amidst the joy and
tears with which he pronounced the beloved name, he
thought his heart would have leaped from his mouth;
and he affirmed that this most sweet name, as honeycomb,
melted into the depths of his soul. Whereat he
exclaims: Oh most sweet name! oh Mary, what must
thou thyself be, if thy name alone is so lovely and
sweet?</p>

<p>The enamored St. Bernard, too, addressing his good
mother with tenderness, says to her: Oh great, oh
merciful Mary, most holy Virgin, worthy of all praise,
thy name is so sweet and lovely that it cannot be
spoken without enkindling love to thee and to God in
the heart of him who pronounces it; the thought of
it alone is enough to console thy lovers, and inflame<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_309"></a>[309]</span>
them with a far greater love to thee.<a id="FNanchor_834" href="#Footnote_834" class="fnanchor">[834]</a> If riches are
a consolation to the poor, because by them they are
relieved of their miseries, oh how much more, says
Richard of St. Laurence, does thy name console us
sinners, oh Mary; far more than the riches of earth it
relieves us in the troubles of the present life.<a id="FNanchor_835" href="#Footnote_835" class="fnanchor">[835]</a></p>

<p>In a word, thy name, oh mother of God, is full of
grace and divine blessings, as St. Methodius says.<a id="FNanchor_836" href="#Footnote_836" class="fnanchor">[836]</a>
And St. Bonaventure affirms that thy name cannot
be pronounced but it brings some grace to him who
devoutly utters it.<a id="FNanchor_837" href="#Footnote_837" class="fnanchor">[837]</a> So great is the virtue of thy
name, oh most compassionate Virgin, says the Idiot,
that no one can pronounce it, however hardened, however
desponding may be his heart, and not find it
wonderfully softened; for it is thou who dost console
sinners with the hope of pardon and of grace.<a id="FNanchor_838" href="#Footnote_838" class="fnanchor">[838]</a> Thy
most sweet name, according to St. Ambrose, is a sweet
ointment, which breathes the fragrance of divine grace.<a id="FNanchor_839" href="#Footnote_839" class="fnanchor">[839]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310"></a>[310]</span>
The saint thus invokes the divine mother: May this
oil of salvation descend into the depths of our soul;
by which he intends to say: Oh Lady, remind us often
to pronounce thy name with love and confidence; for
thus to name thee, either is a sign that we already
possess divine grace, or it is an earnest that we shall
soon recover it.</p>

<p>For as Landolph of Saxony expresses it: The remembrance
of thy name, oh Mary, consoles the
afflicted, brings back the wanderer to the path of
salvation, encourages the sinner, and saves him from
despair;<a id="FNanchor_840" href="#Footnote_840" class="fnanchor">[840]</a> and Father Pelbart remarks, that as Jesus
Christ by his five wounds has prepared for the world
the remedy for its woes, thus also Mary, with her most
holy name, which is composed of five letters, confers
every day pardon upon sinners.<a id="FNanchor_841" href="#Footnote_841" class="fnanchor">[841]</a></p>

<p>For this reason, the holy name of Mary in the sacred
Canticles is compared to oil: Thy name is as
oil poured out: “Oleum effusum nomen tuum.”<a id="FNanchor_842" href="#Footnote_842" class="fnanchor">[842]</a>
The blessed Alanus, commenting on this passage,
says: The glory of her name is compared to oil
poured out. As oil heals the sick, diffuses odor, and
kindles flame; thus the name of Mary heals sinners,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_311"></a>[311]</span>
rejoices hearts, and inflames them with divine
love.<a id="FNanchor_843" href="#Footnote_843" class="fnanchor">[843]</a> Hence Richard of St. Laurence encourages
sinners to invoke this great name, because that alone
will be sufficient to cure all their maladies; adding,
that there is no disease so malignant that it will not at
once yield to the virtue of this name.<a id="FNanchor_844" href="#Footnote_844" class="fnanchor">[844]</a></p>

<p>On the other hand, the devils, as Thomas à Kempis
affirms, are in such fear of the queen of heaven that
at the sound of her great name they flee from him
who pronounces it as from burning fire.<a id="FNanchor_845" href="#Footnote_845" class="fnanchor">[845]</a> The Virgin
herself revealed to St. Bridget that there is no sinner
living so cold in divine love, that if he invokes her
holy name, with the resolution to amend, the devil
will not instantly depart from him.<a id="FNanchor_846" href="#Footnote_846" class="fnanchor">[846]</a> And she at
another time assured her of this, telling her that all
the demons so greatly venerate and fear her name,
that when they hear it pronounced they immediately
release the soul which they held in their chains.<a id="FNanchor_847" href="#Footnote_847" class="fnanchor">[847]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_312"></a>[312]</span></p>

<p>And as the rebel angels depart from sinners who
invoke the name of Mary, thus, on the contrary, our
Lady herself told St. Bridget, that the good angels
draw more closely around those just souls who devoutly
pronounce it.<a id="FNanchor_848" href="#Footnote_848" class="fnanchor">[848]</a> And St. Germanus assures us,
that as breathing is a sign of life, so the frequent
utterance of the name of Mary is a sign that we are
already living in divine grace, or that we shall soon
receive that life; for this powerful name is effectual to
obtain help and life for him who devoutly invokes it.<a id="FNanchor_849" href="#Footnote_849" class="fnanchor">[849]</a>
Finally, Richard of St. Laurence adds, that this admirable
name is like a tower of strength, by taking
shelter in which the sinner will be saved from death,
since from this celestial tower the most abandoned
sinners come forth securely defended and saved.<a id="FNanchor_850" href="#Footnote_850" class="fnanchor">[850]</a></p>

<p>A tower of strength, thus continues the same
Richard, which not only shields sinners from punishment,
but also defends the just from the assaults of
hell; and he adds: Next to the name of Jesus there is
no name which gives such support, and through
which so great salvation is bestowed upon men, as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_313"></a>[313]</span>
this great name of Mary.<a id="FNanchor_851" href="#Footnote_851" class="fnanchor">[851]</a> Especially is it everywhere
known, and the servants of Mary daily experience,
that her great name gives strength to overcome
temptations against chastity. The same author,
remarking on the words of St. Luke: And the name
of the Virgin was Mary: “Et nomen Virginis Maria,”<a id="FNanchor_852" href="#Footnote_852" class="fnanchor">[852]</a>
says, that these two names, of Mary and of Virgin,
are united by the evangelist to show that the name of
this most pure Virgin can never be separated from
chastity.<a id="FNanchor_853" href="#Footnote_853" class="fnanchor">[853]</a> Hence St. Peter Chrysologus says, that
the name Mary is a sign of chastity: “Nomen hoc
indicium castitatis;”<a id="FNanchor_854" href="#Footnote_854" class="fnanchor">[854]</a> meaning, that whoever is in doubt
whether he has yielded to temptations against purity,
if he remembers having invoked the name of Mary
may be sure that he has not violated chastity.</p>

<p>Let us, then, always follow the beautiful counsel
of St. Bernard, who says: In every danger of
losing divine grace let us think of Mary, let us
invoke the name of Mary together with that of Jesus,
for these names are always united. Let these
two most sweet and powerful names never depart
from our heart and our lips, for they will always give
us strength to keep us from falling, and to conquer<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_314"></a>[314]</span>
every temptation.<a id="FNanchor_855" href="#Footnote_855" class="fnanchor">[855]</a> Very precious are the graces
which Jesus Christ hast promised to those who are
devoted to the name of Mary, as he himself, speaking
to his holy mother, gave St. Bridget to understand, revealing
to her that whoever will invoke the name of
Mary with confidence and a purpose of amendment,
shall receive three special graces: namely, a perfect
contrition for his sins, the grace to make satisfaction
for them and strength to obtain perfection, and at
last, the glory of paradise;<a id="FNanchor_856" href="#Footnote_856" class="fnanchor">[856]</a> for as the divine Saviour
added: “Thy words are so sweet and dear to me, oh
my mother, that I cannot refuse thee what thou dost
ask.”<a id="FNanchor_857" href="#Footnote_857" class="fnanchor">[857]</a></p>

<p>Finally, St. Ephrem adds that the name of Mary is
the key of the gate of heaven to him who devoutly
invokes it;<a id="FNanchor_858" href="#Footnote_858" class="fnanchor">[858]</a> and therefore St. Bonaventure rightly
calls Mary the salvation of all those who invoke her:
“O salus te invocantium;” as if it were the same
thing to invoke the name of Mary and to obtain eternal
salvation; for as the Idiot affirms: The invocation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_315"></a>[315]</span>
of this holy and sweet name leads to the acquisition of
superabundant grace in this life, and sublime glory in
another.<a id="FNanchor_859" href="#Footnote_859" class="fnanchor">[859]</a> If you desire, then, brethren, concludes
Thomas à Kempis, to be consoled in every affliction,
have recourse to Mary, invoke Mary, honor Mary, recommend
yourselves to Mary. Rejoice with Mary, weep
with Mary, pray with Mary, walk with Mary, and
with Mary seek Jesus; in a word, with Jesus and
Mary desire to live and to die. Do this, he adds, and
you will always advance in the way of the Lord; for
Mary will pray for you, and the Son will surely graciously
listen to the mother.<a id="FNanchor_860" href="#Footnote_860" class="fnanchor">[860]</a> Such are his beautiful
words.</p>

<p>Very sweet, then, in life to her servants, is the most
holy name of Mary, on account of the great graces
which it obtains for them, as we have seen above;
but sweeter still will it be to them in dying by the
sweet and holy death she will obtain for them.
Father Sertorio Caputo, of the Society of Jesus, exhorted
all those who were called to the bedside of
the dying, often to pronounce the name of Mary, saying<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_316"></a>[316]</span>
that this name of life and of hope, pronounced in
death, is alone sufficient to scatter the enemies and to
comfort the dying in all their anguishes. St. Camillus
of Lellis also strongly recommended it to his religious,
that they should remind the dying often to invoke the
name of Mary and of Jesus, as he always practised it
with others; but more sweetly he practised it himself
at the moment of his death, when, as we read in his
life, he named with so much tenderness his beloved
names of Jesus and Mary, that he inflamed also with
love of them all those who heard him. And at length,
with his eyes fixed on their adorable image, and his
arms crossed, the saint expired in celestial peace, pronouncing
with his last breath the most sweet names
of Jesus and Mary. This short prayer of invoking
the holy names of Jesus and Mary, says Thomas à
Kempis, which it is as easy to retain in the memory
as it is sweet to consider, is at the same time powerful
to protect whoever uses it from all the enemies of our
salvation.<a id="FNanchor_861" href="#Footnote_861" class="fnanchor">[861]</a></p>

<p>Blessed is he, says St. Bonaventure, who loves thy
sweet name, oh mother of God.<a id="FNanchor_862" href="#Footnote_862" class="fnanchor">[862]</a> Thy name is so
glorious and admirable, that those who remember to
invoke it at the moment of death, do not then fear all
the assaults of the enemy.<a id="FNanchor_863" href="#Footnote_863" class="fnanchor">[863]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_317"></a>[317]</span></p>

<p>Oh, the happy lot of dying as Father Fulgentius of
Ascoli, a Capuchin, died, who expired singing: Oh
Mary, Mary, the most lovely of all beings, let me
depart in thy company. Or, as blessed Henry the
Cistercian, of whom it is related in the annals of the
order, that he died with the name of Mary on his
lips.<a id="FNanchor_864" href="#Footnote_864" class="fnanchor">[864]</a> Let us pray, then, my devout reader, let us
pray God to grant us this grace, that the last word
we pronounce at death may be the name of Mary;
as St. Germanus desired and prayed.<a id="FNanchor_865" href="#Footnote_865" class="fnanchor">[865]</a> Oh sweet
death, oh safe death, that is accompanied and protected
by such a name of salvation, that God does
not permit it to be invoked in death, except by those
whom he will save!</p>

<p>Oh, my sweet Lady and mother, I love thee much,
and because I love thee, I love also thy holy name.
I purpose and hope with thy aid always to invoke it
in life and death. For the glory, then, of thy name
(let us conclude with the tender prayer of St. Bonaventure),
when my soul departs from this world, wilt
thou come to meet it, oh blessed Lady, and take it in
thy arms?<a id="FNanchor_866" href="#Footnote_866" class="fnanchor">[866]</a> Do not disdain, oh Mary, let us continue
to pray with the saint, to come and comfort it, then,
with thy sweet presence. Thou art its ladder and
way to paradise. Wilt thou obtain for me the grace<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_318"></a>[318]</span>
of pardon and eternal rest?<a id="FNanchor_867" href="#Footnote_867" class="fnanchor">[867]</a> And the saint then terminates
with saying: Oh Mary, our advocate, to thee
it belongs to shield thy servants, and defend their
cause before the tribunal of Jesus Christ.<a id="FNanchor_868" href="#Footnote_868" class="fnanchor">[868]</a></p>

<h5>EXAMPLE.</h5>

<p>It is related by Father Rho, in his Sabbati, and by
Father Lireo, in his Trisagio Mariana, of a certain
young maiden of Guelder-land, who lived about the
year 1465, that she was sent one day by her uncle to
purchase something at the market of the city of Nimeguen,
with the direction to go and pass the night
at the house of her aunt, who lived in the town. The
girl obeyed, but when she went at night to her aunt’s
house, she was rudely sent away by her, and she set
out on her way homewards. Night overtaking her,
she fell into a passion, and called loudly upon the
devil to come to her aid. And behold, he suddenly
appeared in the form of a man, and promised to assist
her, provided she would do one thing. I will do any
thing, answered the unhappy creature. I only wish,
said the enemy, that henceforth you will not bless
yourself with the sign of the cross, and will change
your name. As to the cross, she answered, I will no
longer sign myself with it, but my name of Mary is
too dear to me, I will not change it. Then I will not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_319"></a>[319]</span>
help you, said the devil. At length, after much debate,
it was agreed that she should be called by the
first letter of the name of Mary, that is, Emme.
They then went together to Antwerp, and the wretched
girl remained there six years with her diabolical companion,
living so sinful a life, that it was the scandal
of the whole place. One day she told the devil that
she wished to see her country again; the enemy objected,
but finally was obliged to consent. When they
entered together the city of Nimeguen, there was just
then performing a public representation of the life of
the most holy Mary. At such a sight the poor Emme,
from that little devotion she had still preserved towards
the mother of God, began to weep. “What
are we doing here?” said her companion: “would you
perform here another comedy?” He then seized her
to take her away, but she resisted, and seeing that
she was escaping from him, in a rage he raised her
into the air and let her fall in the midst of the theatre.
The poor girl then related what had happened to her.
She went to the parish priest to confess, but he sent
her to the Bishop of Cologne, and the bishop sent her
to the Pope, who, having heard her confession, imposed
it upon her as a penance, that she should wear
three rings of iron, one around her neck, and two
around her arms. The penitent obeyed, and having
arrived at Maestricht, she retired into a convent of
penitents, where she lived for fourteen years in severe
penance. One morning she arose from her bed and
found the three rings broken. Two years after, she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_320"></a>[320]</span>
died in the odor of sanctity, and wished to have the
rings buried with her, which had changed her from a
slave of hell into the happy slave of Mary, her deliverer.</p>

<h5>PRAYER.</h5>

<p>Oh great mother of God, and my mother Mary,
it is true that I am unworthy to pronounce thy name,
but thou who lovest me, and dost desire my salvation,
thou must obtain for me, that, unclean as may be
my tongue, I may yet always invoke thy most holy
and most powerful name; for thy name is the support
of the living, and the salvation of the dying. Ah,
most pure Mary! ah, most sweet Mary! make thy
name henceforth to be the breath of my life. Oh
Lady, do not delay coming to my help when I call
upon thee, since in all the temptations which may
assail me, in all the necessities I may suffer, I shall
never cease calling upon thee, always repeating Mary,
Mary. Thus I hope to do in life, thus especially I
hope to do in death, that I may afterwards come
to praise eternally in heaven thy beloved name: O
clemens! O pia! O dulcis Virgo Maria! Ah Mary!
Mary most amiable! what comfort, what sweetness,
what confidence, what tenderness does my soul feel
only in pronouncing thy name, only in thinking of
thee! I thank my God and my Lord that he has
given thee, for my good, this name so sweet, so lovely,
so powerful.</p>

<p>But, oh my Lady, I am not satisfied with merely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_321"></a>[321]</span>
pronouncing thy name, I would pronounce it also with
love; I desire that my love may remind me to speak
thy name at every hour, that I may exclaim with St.
Anselm: Oh name of the mother of God, thou art
my love. O amor mei nomen matris Dei.</p>

<p>Oh my dear mother Mary! oh my beloved Jesus!
may your most sweet names always live in my own
and in all hearts. May I forget all other names, that
I may remember and always invoke none but your
adored names. Ah Jesus, my Redeemer! and my
mother Mary, when the moment of my death shall
arrive, and my soul shall depart from this life, by
your merits grant me the grace then to utter my last
accents, repeating: <i>I love you, Jesus and Mary</i>;
Jesus and Mary, I give you my heart and my soul.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="SOME_DEVOUT_PRAYERS">SOME DEVOUT PRAYERS
OF VARIOUS SAINTS
TO THE HOLY MOTHER.</h3>

</div>

<p>The following prayers are added, not only for the use of the
faithful, but also because they show the great idea which the
saints entertained of the power and mercy of Mary, and their
great confidence in her patronage.</p>

<h4>Prayer of St. Ephrem.</h4>

<p>Oh immaculate and wholly pure Virgin Mary!
mother of God, queen of the universe, our most excellent
Lady, thou art superior to all the saints, thou art the
only hope of the Fathers, and the joy of the blessed.
By thee we have been reconciled to our God. Thou art
the only advocate of sinners, the secure haven of the
shipwrecked. Thou art the consolation of the world,
the redemption of captives, the joy of the sick, the
comfort of the afflicted, the refuge and salvation of
the whole world. Oh great princess! mother of God!
cover us with the wings of thy compassion: have pity
on us. We have no hope but in thee, oh most pure
Virgin! We are given to thee, and consecrated to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_323"></a>[323]</span>
thy service; we bear the name of thy servants; do
not permit Lucifer to draw us down to hell. Oh immaculate
Virgin! we are under thy protection; therefore,
unitedly we have recourse to thee, and supplicate
thee to prevent thy Son, whom our sins have offended,
from abandoning us to the power of the devil.</p>

<p>Oh full of grace! illuminate my intellect, loosen my
tongue that it may sing thy praises, and especially
the Angelic Salutation, so worthy of thee. I salute
thee, oh peace! oh joy! oh salvation and consolation
of the whole world! I salute thee, oh greatest of
miracles! paradise of delight! secure haven of those
who are in danger! fountain of grace! mediatrix of
God and of men!</p>

<h4>Prayer of St. Bernard.</h4>

<p>We raise our eyes to thee, oh queen of the world!
After having committed so many sins we must appear
before our Judge, and who will appease him?
None can do it better than thou, oh blessed Lady, who
hast loved him so much, and hast been so tenderly
beloved by him. Open thy heart, then, oh mother of
mercy, to our sighs and prayers. We fly to thy protection;
appease the anger of thy Son, and restore
us to his favor. Thou dost not abhor the sinner, however
loathsome he may be; thou dost not despise him,
if he sends up his sighs to thee, and with contrition
asks thy intercession; thou, with thy kind hand, dost
deliver him from despair; thou dost encourage him to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_324"></a>[324]</span>
hope, dost comfort him, and dost not leave him until
thou hast reconciled him to his Judge.</p>

<p>Thou art that only one in whom the Saviour found
his rest, and with whom he has deposited all his
treasures. Hence all the world, oh Mary, honors thy
chaste womb, as the temple of God, where the salvation
of the world had its beginning. In thee was
effected the reconciliation between God and man.
Thou art the inclosed garden, oh great mother of
God, whose flowers have never been gathered by the
sinner’s hand. Thou art the beautiful garden, in
which God has placed all the flowers which adorn
the Church, such as the violet of thy humility, the
lily of thy purity, and the rose of thy charity. Who
can be compared to thee, oh mother of grace and of
beauty? Thou art the paradise of God. From thee
hath sprung up the fountain of living water, that
waters all the earth. Oh, how many favors hast thou
bestowed upon the world, by meriting to be the channel
of the waters of salvation!</p>

<p>Of thee the Holy Ghost speaks when he says: Who
is she that arises like the dawn, fair as the moon,
bright as the sun? Thou art, then, come into the
world, oh Mary, as a resplendent dawn, preceding,
with the light of thy sanctity, the coming of the Sun
of Justice. The day in which thou didst appear in
the world may truly be called the day of salvation,
the day of grace. Thou art fair as the moon; for
as there is no planet more like the sun, so there is
no creature more like to God than thou art. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_325"></a>[325]</span>
moon illuminates the night with the light which it receives
from the sun, and thou dost illuminate our
darkness with the splendor of thy virtues; and thou
art fairer than the moon, because in thee is found
neither stain nor shade. Thou art bright as the
sun, I mean as that Sun which hath created the sun;
he has been chosen among all men, and thou among
all women. Oh sweet, oh great, oh most lovely
Mary, thy name cannot be pronounced by any one
that thou dost not inflame him with thy love; neither
can those who love thee think of thee without feeling
themselves encouraged to love thee more.</p>

<p>Oh blessed Lady, help our weakness. And who is
more fit to speak to our Lord Jesus Christ than thou,
who dost enjoy, so near to him, his sweet conversation?
Speak, speak, oh Lady, because thy Son
listens, and thou wilt obtain from him whatever thou
shalt demand.</p>

<h4>Prayer of St. Germanus.</h4>

<p>Oh my only Lady, who art the sole consolation
which I receive from God; thou who art the only
celestial dew that doth soothe my pains; thou who
art the light of my soul when it is surrounded with
darkness; thou who art my guide in my journeyings,
my strength in my weakness, my treasure in my poverty;
balm for my wounds, my consolation in sorrow;
thou who art my refuge in misery, the hope of my
salvation, graciously hear my prayer, have pity on
me, as is befitting the mother of a God who hath so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_326"></a>[326]</span>
much love for men. Thou who art our defence and
joy, grant me what I ask; make me worthy of enjoying
with thee that great happiness which thou dost enjoy
in heaven. Yes, my Lady, my refuge, my life, my
help, my defence, my strength, my joy, my hope,
make me to come with thee to paradise. I know
that, being the mother of God thou canst obtain
this for me if thou wilt. Oh Mary, thou art omnipotent
to save sinners, thou needest nothing else to
recommend us to thee, for thou art the mother of true
life.</p>

<h4>Prayer of the Abbot of Celles,<br>
surnamed the idiot.</h4>

<p>Draw me after thee, oh Virgin Mary, that I may
run to the odor of thy perfumes. Draw me, for I
am held back by the weight of my sins, and by the
malice of my enemies. As no one goes to thy Son
unless the divine Father draws him, so I would dare
to say, in a certain sense, that no one goes to him if
thou dost not draw him with thy holy prayers. It is
thou who teachest true wisdom; thou who dost obtain
pardon for sinners, because thou art their advocate.
It is thou who dost promise glory to him who honors
thee, because thou art the treasurer of graces.</p>

<p>Thou hast found grace with God, oh most sweet
Virgin, because thou hast been preserved from the
stain of original sin, filled with the Holy Spirit, and
hast conceived the Son of God. Thou hast received
all these graces, oh Mary most humble, not only for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_327"></a>[327]</span>
thyself, but also for us, that thou mayest help us in
all our necessities. And thou, indeed, dost so; thou
dost succor the good by preserving them in grace;
and the bad, by bringing them to receive the divine
mercy; thou dost aid the dying by protecting them
against the snares of the devil; and thou dost aid
them also after death by receiving their souls, and
leading them to the kingdom of the blessed.</p>

<h4>Prayer of St. Methodius.</h4>

<p>Thy name, oh mother of God, is full of all graces
and divine blessings. Thou hast comprehended him
who is incomprehensible, and nourished him who
nourishes all living creatures. He who fills heaven
and earth and is Lord of all, has chosen to have need
of thee, since thou hast clothed him with that garment
of flesh that he had not before. Rejoice, oh
mother and handmaid of God! rejoice! rejoice! thou
hast for a debtor him to whom all creatures owe their
being. We are all debtors to God, but God is a
debtor to thee. Hence it is, oh most holy mother of
God, that thou hast greater goodness and greater
charity than all the other saints, and more than all
others hast near access in heaven to God, because thou
art his mother. Ah, we pray thee that we may celebrate
thy glories, and may know how great is thy
goodness, being mindful of us and of our miseries.</p>

<h4>Prayer of St. John Damascene.</h4>

<p>I salute thee, oh Mary! thou art the hope of Christians;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_328"></a>[328]</span>
receive the petition of a servant who tenderly
loves thee, especially honors thee, and places in thee
all the hope of his salvation. From thee I have life,
thou dost restore me to the favor of thy Son; thou
art the certain pledge of my salvation. I implore
thee, then, to deliver me from the burden of my sins;
dispel the darkness of my mind; banish earthly affections
from my heart; repel the temptations of my enemies,
and so order my life, that I may reach, by thy
means and by thy guidance, the eternal felicity of
paradise.</p>

<h4>Prayer of St. Andrew of Candia, or of Jerusalem.</h4>

<p>I salute thee, oh full of grace! the Lord is with
thee. I salute thee, oh cause of our joy, by whom
the sentence of our condemnation has been already
revoked, and changed into a judgment of benediction.
I salute thee, oh temple of the glory of God,
sacred house of the King of Heaven. Thou art
the reconciliation of God with men. I salute thee, oh
mother of our joy. In truth thou art blessed, for
thou alone, among all women, hast been found worthy
of being the mother of thy Creator. All nations call
thee blessed.</p>

<p>Oh Mary, if I put my confidence in thee I shall be
saved; if I am under thy protection I have nothing
to fear, for to be thy servant is to have the secure
armor of salvation, which God does not grant except
to those whom he will save.</p>

<p>Oh mother of mercy, appease thy Son. Whilst<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_329"></a>[329]</span>
thou wast on earth thou didst only occupy a small
part of it; but now that thou art raised above the
highest heaven, the whole world considers thee as
the propitiatory of all nations. We supplicate thee,
then, oh holy Virgin, to grant us the aid of thy
prayers with God; prayers which are dearer and
more precious to us than all the treasures of earth;
prayers that render God inclined to forgive our sins;
and wilt thou obtain for us abundant graces to receive
the pardon of them and to practise virtue? prayers
that conquer our enemies, confound their designs, and
triumph over their forces.</p>

<h4>Prayer of St. Ildephonsus</h4>

<p>I come to thee, oh mother of God, I supplicate
thee to obtain for me the pardon of my sins, and
that I may be purified from all the errors of my
life. I pray thee to grant me thy grace, that I may
unite myself with affection to thy Son and to thee; to
thy Son as to my God, to thee as to the mother of
my God.</p>

<h4>Prayer of St. Athanasius.</h4>

<p>Hearken oh most holy Virgin, to our prayers, and
remember us. Dispense to us the gifts of thy riches,
and the abundant graces with which thou art filled.
The archangel salutes thee and calls thee full of
grace. All nations call thee blessed; the whole hierarchy
of heaven blesses thee, and we, who are of the
terrestrial hierarchy, also say to thee: “Hail, full of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_330"></a>[330]</span>
grace, the Lord is with thee;” pray for us, oh mother
of God, our Lady and our Queen.</p>

<h4>Prayer of St. Anselm</h4>

<p>We pray thee, oh most blessed Lady, by that grace
which God bestowed on thee when he so greatly exalted
thee, rendering all things possible to thee with him;
we pray thee to obtain for us that the fulness of
grace which thou hast merited may make us to
share thy glory. Be pleased, oh most merciful
Lady, to procure for us the good for which God
consented to become man in thy chaste womb. Be
not slow to hear us. If thou wilt deign to supplicate
thy Son, he at once will graciously hear thee. It is
enough that thou wilt save us, for then we cannot but
be saved. Who can restrain the bowels of thy compassion?
If thou hast not compassion on us, thou
who art the mother of mercy, what will become of us
when thy Son shall come to judge us?</p>

<p>Come, then, to our succor, oh most compassionate
mother, without regarding the multitude of our sins.
Remember again and again that our Creator has taken
human flesh from thee, not to condemn sinners, but to
save them. If thou hadst been made mother of God
only for thine own advantage, it might be said that it
would be to thee of little importance whether we were
saved or condemned; but God has clothed himself
with thy flesh for thy salvation and for that of all
men. What will it avail us that thou art so powerful
and so glorious, if thou dost not render us partakers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_331"></a>[331]</span>
of thy felicity? Aid us and protect us; remember the
need we have of thy assistance. We recommend ourselves
to thee; save us from damnation, and make us
serve and love eternally thy Son Jesus Christ.</p>

<h4>Prayer of St. Peter Damian.</h4>

<p>Holy Virgin, mother of God, succor those who
implore thy assistance. Turn to us. But, having been
deified, as it were, hast thou forgotten men? Ah,
certainly not. Thou knowest in what peril thou hast
left us, and the wretched condition of thy servants;
no, it is not befitting a mercy so great, to forget so
great misery as ours. Turn to us with thy power,
because he who is powerful hath given thee omnipotence
in heaven and on earth. To thee nothing is impossible,
for thou canst raise even the despairing to
the hope of salvation. Thou must be compassionate
as thou art powerful.</p>

<p>Turn to us, also, in thy love. I know, oh my Lady,
that thou art all kindness, and dost love us with a love
that no other love can surpass. How often dost
thou appease the anger of our Judge, when he is on
the point of punishing us for our offences! All the
treasures of the mercy of God are in thy hands. Ah,
may it never happen that thou shouldst cease from
doing us good: thou seekest but the occasion of saving
all sinners, and of bestowing thy mercy upon them;
for thy glory is increased when, by thy means, penitents
are pardoned, and the pardoned come to paradise.
Turn, then, to us, that we may come to see<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_332"></a>[332]</span>
thee in heaven; for the greatest glory we can obtain
next to seeing God, is to see thee, to love thee, and to
be under thy protection. Ah, graciously hear us,
since thy Son wishes to honor thee, by granting all
thy requests.</p>

<h4>Prayer of St. William, Bishop of Paris.</h4>

<p>Oh mother of God, I fly to thee and I implore
thee not to cast me off, for the whole Church of the
faithful calls thee, and proclaims thee the mother of
mercy. Thou art so dear to God, that thou art always
graciously heard; thy compassion has never been
wanting to any one; thy most gracious condescension
has never despised any sinner, however enormous his
sin, who has recommended himself to thee. Does the
Church falsely and in vain call thee her advocate, and
the refuge of the unhappy? No; let my sins never
prevent thee from exercising thy great office of mercy
by which thou art the advocate, the mediatrix of reconciliation,
the only hope, and the most secure refuge
of sinners. Let it never be that the mother, who, for
the good of the whole world, brought forth him who
is the fountain of mercy, should refuse her mercy to
any sinner who has recourse to her. It is thy office
to reconcile God to man; let, then, thy compassion
move thee to help me, for it is greater than all my sins.</p>

<h4>Prayer to the most Holy Mary<br>
to be said every day at the end of the visit.</h4>

<p>Oh most holy, immaculate Virgin, and my mother
Mary, to thee who art the mother of my Lord, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_333"></a>[333]</span>
queen of the world, the advocate, the hope, the refuge
of sinners, I, the most miserable of all, have recourse
to-day. I adore thee, oh great queen, and thank thee
for all the favors thou hast hitherto granted me, especially
for having delivered me from hell, which I
have so often deserved. I love thee, oh most amiable
Lady, and through the love I bear thee promise that
I will always serve thee, and do all that I can that
thou mayest also be loved by others. I place in
thee all my hopes of salvation; accept me for thy
servant, and receive me under thy mantle, oh thou
mother of mercy. And since thou art so powerful
with God, deliver me from all temptations, or obtain
for me the strength to conquer them always until
death. From thee I ask a true love for Jesus Christ;
from thee do I hope to die a good death. Oh, my
mother, by the love thou bearest to God, I pray thee
always to help me, but most of all at the last moment
of my life. Do not leave me until thou seest me actually
safe in heaven, blessing thee, and singing thy
mercies through all eternity. Amen. Thus I hope.
Thus may it be.</p>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>How befitting it was to all Three of the Divine Persons that
Mary should be preserved from original sin.</i></p>

</div>

<p>The ruin was great which accursed sin brought
upon Adam and the whole human race; for when he
unhappily lost grace, he at the same time lost the
other blessings with which, in the beginning, he was
enriched, and drew upon himself, and upon all his
descendants, both the displeasure of God, and all other
evils. But God ordained that the blessed Virgin
should be exempt from this common calamity, for he
had destined her to be the mother of the second Adam,
Jesus Christ, who was to repair the injury done by
the first. Now, let us see how fitting it was that
the Three Divine Persons should preserve this Virgin
from original sin. We shall see that it was befitting
the Father to preserve her from it as his daughter,
the Son as his mother, the Holy Spirit as his spouse.</p>

<p><i>First Point.</i>—In the first place, it was fitting that
the eternal Father should create Mary free from the
original stain, because she was his daughter, and his
first-born daughter, as she herself attests: “I came<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_338"></a>[338]</span>
out of the mouth of the Most High, the first-born
before all creatures;”<a id="FNanchor_869" href="#Footnote_869" class="fnanchor">[869]</a> for this passage is applied to
Mary by the sacred interpreters, by the holy Fathers,
and by the Church herself, on the solemn festival of
her Conception. Whether she be the first-born on
account of her predestination, together with her Son,
in the divine decrees, before all creatures, as the school
of the Scotists will have it; or the first-born of grace,
as predestined to be the mother of the Redeemer, after
the prevision of sin, according to the school of the
Thomists, all agree in calling her the first-born of God;
which being the case, it was not meet that Mary should
be the slave of Lucifer, but that she should only and
always be possessed by her Creator, as she herself
asserts: “The Lord possessed me in the beginning of
his ways.”<a id="FNanchor_870" href="#Footnote_870" class="fnanchor">[870]</a> Hence Mary was rightly called by Dionysius,
Archbishop of Alexandria: One and sole daughter
of life: “Una et sola filia vitæ;”<a id="FNanchor_871" href="#Footnote_871" class="fnanchor">[871]</a> differing in
this from others, who being born in sin, are daughters
of death.</p>

<p>Moreover, it was meet that the eternal Father should
create her in his grace, since he destined her for the
restorer of the lost world, and mediatrix of peace between
man and God; and thus the holy Fathers name
her, and especially St. John Damascene, who thus addresses<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_339"></a>[339]</span>
her: Oh blessed Virgin, thou art born to procure
the salvation of the whole world!<a id="FNanchor_872" href="#Footnote_872" class="fnanchor">[872]</a> St. Bernard
says that Mary was already prefigured in the ark of
Noe; for as by the ark men were saved from the
deluge, so by Mary we are saved from the shipwreck
of sin; but with this difference, that by means
of the ark few only were saved, but by means of
Mary the whole human race has been redeemed.<a id="FNanchor_873" href="#Footnote_873" class="fnanchor">[873]</a>
Hence it is that Mary is called by St. Athanasius:
The new Eve, the mother of life: “Nova Eva, mater
vitæ.”<a id="FNanchor_874" href="#Footnote_874" class="fnanchor">[874]</a> A new Eve, because the first was the mother
of death, but the most holy Virgin is mother of life.
St. Theophanes, Bishop of Nice, exclaims: Hail to
thee, who hast taken away the sorrow of Eve.<a id="FNanchor_875" href="#Footnote_875" class="fnanchor">[875]</a> St.
Basil calls her: The peacemaker between God and
men.<a id="FNanchor_876" href="#Footnote_876" class="fnanchor">[876]</a> St. Ephrem: The peacemaker of the whole
world.<a id="FNanchor_877" href="#Footnote_877" class="fnanchor">[877]</a></p>

<p>Now, certainly he who treats of peace should not
be an enemy of the offended person, still less an accomplice
of his crime. St. Gregory says, that to appease
the judge his enemy certainly must not be
chosen, for instead of appeasing him he would enrage<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_340"></a>[340]</span>
him more. Therefore, as Mary was to be the mediatrix
of peace between God and man, there was every
reason why she should not appear as a sinner and
enemy of God, but as his friend, and pure from sin.</p>

<p>Besides, it was fitting that God should preserve her
from original sin, since he destined her to bruise the
head of the infernal serpent, who, by seducing our first
parents, brought death upon all men, as our Lord predicted:
“I will put enmities between thee and the
woman, and thy seed and her seed; she shall crush
thy head.”<a id="FNanchor_878" href="#Footnote_878" class="fnanchor">[878]</a> Now, if Mary was to be the strong
woman brought into the world to crush Lucifer, surely
it was not fitting that she should first be conquered
by Lucifer, and made his slave, but rather that she
should be free from every stain, and from all subjection
to the enemy. As he had in his pride already
corrupted the whole human race, he would also corrupt
the pure soul of this Virgin. But may the
divine goodness be ever praised, who prevented her
with so much grace, to the end that remaining free
from every stain of sin, she could overthrow and confound
his pride, as St. Augustine says, or whoever
may have been the author of that commentary upon
Genesis: As the devil was the head from whence
original sin proceeded, that head Mary crushed, because
no sin ever entered the soul of the Virgin, and
therefore she was free from all stain.<a id="FNanchor_879" href="#Footnote_879" class="fnanchor">[879]</a> St. Bonaventure<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_341"></a>[341]</span>
still more clearly expresses the same: It was
meet that the blessed Virgin Mary, by whom our
shame was to be removed, should conquer the devil,
and that she should not yield to him in the least
degree.<a id="FNanchor_880" href="#Footnote_880" class="fnanchor">[880]</a></p>

<p>But it was especially fitting that the eternal Father
should preserve his daughter from the sin of Adam,
because he destined her for the mother of his only
begotten Son. Thou wast preordained in the mind
of God, before every creature, to bring forth God
himself made man.<a id="FNanchor_881" href="#Footnote_881" class="fnanchor">[881]</a> If for no other reason, then,
at least for the honor of his Son, who was God, the
Father would create her pure from every stain. The
angelic Doctor St. Thomas says, that all things
ordained by God must be holy, and pure from every
defilement.<a id="FNanchor_882" href="#Footnote_882" class="fnanchor">[882]</a> If David, when he was planning the
temple of Jerusalem with a magnificence worthy the
Lord, said: “Not for man a house is prepared, but
for God;”<a id="FNanchor_883" href="#Footnote_883" class="fnanchor">[883]</a> now, how much greater cause have we to
believe that the great Creator, having destined Mary to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_342"></a>[342]</span>
be the mother of his own Son, would adorn her soul
with every grace, that it might be a worthy habitation
for a God. God, the creator of all things, affirms
blessed Denis the Carthusian, about to construct a
worthy habitation for his Son, adorned her with all
pleasing gifts.<a id="FNanchor_884" href="#Footnote_884" class="fnanchor">[884]</a> And the holy Church herself assures
us of this, when she affirms that God prepared the
body and soul of the Virgin to be, on earth, a habitation
worthy of his only begotten Son. “Omnipotent,
eternal God!” thus the holy Church prays, “who, by
the co-operation of the Holy Ghost, didst prepare the
body and soul of the glorious Virgin mother, that she
might become a worthy habitation for thy Son,” &amp;c.<a id="FNanchor_885" href="#Footnote_885" class="fnanchor">[885]</a></p>

<p>It is acknowledged to be the greatest glory of sons
to be born of noble parents. The glory of children
are their fathers: “Gloria filiorum, patres eorum.”<a id="FNanchor_886" href="#Footnote_886" class="fnanchor">[886]</a>
So that in the world the imputation of small fortune
and little science is more endurable than that of low
birth; for the poor man may become rich by industry,
the ignorant learned by study, but he who is of low
birth can hardly become noble; and if ever this occurs,
the old and original reproach is liable always to be revived.
How can we then believe that God, when he
was able to give his Son a noble mother, by preserving<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_343"></a>[343]</span>
her from sin, would have consented that he should
be born of a mother defiled with sin, and permit Lucifer
to reproach him with the opprobrium of being
born of a mother who once was his slave and an enemy
of God! No, the Lord has not permitted this, but he
has well provided for the honor of his Son, by ordaining
that his mother should always be immaculate, that
she might be a fit mother for such a Son. The Greek
Church confirms this: “By a singular providence,
God ordained that the most holy Virgin should be
perfectly pure from the very beginning of her life, as
was becoming her who was to be a mother worthy of
Christ.”<a id="FNanchor_887" href="#Footnote_887" class="fnanchor">[887]</a></p>

<p>It is a common axiom among theologians, that no
gift has ever been granted to any creature with which
the blessed Virgin was not also enriched. St. Bernard
thus expresses it: We certainly cannot suspect
that what has been bestowed on the chosen among
mortals should be withheld from the blessed Virgin.<a id="FNanchor_888" href="#Footnote_888" class="fnanchor">[888]</a>
And St. Thomas of Villanova says: Nothing was
ever given to any of the saints that did not shine more
pre-eminently in Mary from the beginning of her life.<a id="FNanchor_889" href="#Footnote_889" class="fnanchor">[889]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_344"></a>[344]</span>
And if it be true, according to the celebrated saying of
St. John Damascene, that there is an infinite distance
between the mother of God and the servants of
God,<a id="FNanchor_890" href="#Footnote_890" class="fnanchor">[890]</a> it certainly must be supposed, as St. Thomas
teaches, that God has conferred greater graces of
every kind on the mother than on the servants.<a id="FNanchor_891" href="#Footnote_891" class="fnanchor">[891]</a>
Now, asks St. Anselm, the great defender of the privileges
of the immaculate Mary, this being granted,
was the wisdom of God unable to prepare a pure
abode for his Son, free from every human stain?<a id="FNanchor_892" href="#Footnote_892" class="fnanchor">[892]</a>
Has it been in the power of God, continues St. Anselm,
to preserve the angels of heaven unstained amidst
the ruin of so many, and could he not preserve the
mother of his Son and the queen of angels from the
common fall of man?<a id="FNanchor_893" href="#Footnote_893" class="fnanchor">[893]</a> Could God, I add, give the
grace even to an Eve to come into the world immaculate,
and afterwards be unable to bestow it on Mary?</p>

<p>Ah, no, God could do it and has done it, since it
was altogether fitting, as the above-named St. Anselm
says, that this Virgin, to whom God was to give his
only Son, should be adorned with such purity, that it
not only should surpass the purity of all men and of all
angels, but should be second in greatness only to that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_345"></a>[345]</span>
of God.<a id="FNanchor_894" href="#Footnote_894" class="fnanchor">[894]</a> And still more plainly does St. John Damascene
declare, that he preserved the soul as well as
the body of this Virgin, as beseemed her who was about
to receive God into her womb; for he being holy,
dwells only with the holy.<a id="FNanchor_895" href="#Footnote_895" class="fnanchor">[895]</a> Thus the eternal Father
could say to this beloved daughter: “As the lily among
the thorns, so is my love among the daughters.”<a id="FNanchor_896" href="#Footnote_896" class="fnanchor">[896]</a>
Daughter among all my other daughters, thou art
like a lily among thorns; for they are all stained by
sin, but thou wert ever immaculate, and ever my
friend.</p>

<p><i>Second Point.</i>—In the second place, it was befitting
the Son that Mary, as his mother, should be preserved
from sin. It is not permitted to other children to
select a mother according to their good pleasure; but
if this were ever granted to any one, who would
choose a slave for his mother when he might have a
queen? who a peasant, when he might have a noble?
who an enemy of God, when he might have a friend
of God? If, then, the Son of God alone could select
a mother according to his pleasure, it must be considered
as certain that he would choose one befitting
a God. Thus St. Bernard expresses it: The Creator<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_346"></a>[346]</span>
of men to be born of man must choose such a mother
for himself as he knew to be most fit.<a id="FNanchor_897" href="#Footnote_897" class="fnanchor">[897]</a> And as it
was, indeed, fitting that a most pure God should have
a mother pure from all sin, such was she created, as
St. Bernardine of Sienna says, in these words: The
third kind of sanctification is that which is called maternal,
and this removes every stain of original sin.
This was in the blessed Virgin. God, indeed, created
her, by the nobility of her nature as well as by the
perfection of grace, such as it was befitting that his
mother should be.<a id="FNanchor_898" href="#Footnote_898" class="fnanchor">[898]</a> And here the words of the apostle
may be applied: “For it was fitting that we should
have such a high priest, holy, innocent, undefiled, separated
from sinners,”<a id="FNanchor_899" href="#Footnote_899" class="fnanchor">[899]</a> &amp;c. Here a learned author remarks,
that according to St. Paul, it was meet that our
Redeemer should not only be separated from sin, but
also from sinners, as St. Thomas explains it: It was
meet that he who came to take away sins, should be
separate from sinners as far as concerns the sin of
which Adam was guilty.<a id="FNanchor_900" href="#Footnote_900" class="fnanchor">[900]</a> But how could it be said<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_347"></a>[347]</span>
of Jesus Christ that he was separate from sinners if
his mother was a sinner?</p>

<p>St. Ambrose says: Not from earth, but from heaven,
Christ selected this vessel through which he should
descend, and consecrated the temple of modesty.<a id="FNanchor_901" href="#Footnote_901" class="fnanchor">[901]</a>
The saint alludes to the words of St. Paul: “The
first man was of the earth, earthy: the second man
from heaven, heavenly.”<a id="FNanchor_902" href="#Footnote_902" class="fnanchor">[902]</a> St. Ambrose calls the divine
mother: <i>A celestial vessel</i>: not that Mary was
other than earthly in her nature, as heretics have
sometimes fancied, but celestial through grace, for she
was superior to the angels of heaven in sanctity and
purity, as it was meet she should be, when a King of
glory was to dwell in her womb; as John the Baptist
revealed to St. Bridget: “It was befitting the King of
glory to remain in no vessel but one purer and more
select than all angels and men;”<a id="FNanchor_903" href="#Footnote_903" class="fnanchor">[903]</a> to which we may
add what the eternal Father himself said to the same
saint: “Mary was a clean and an unclean vessel. Clean
because she was wholly fair, but unclean because she
was born of sinners; although she was conceived
without sin, that my Son should be born without sin.”<a id="FNanchor_904" href="#Footnote_904" class="fnanchor">[904]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_348"></a>[348]</span>
And these last words are worthy of note, that Mary
was conceived without sin, so that the divine Son
might be conceived without sin. Not that Jesus
Christ could be capable of contracting sin, but that
he might not suffer the opprobrium of having a mother
infected with sin, and a slave of the devil.</p>

<p>The Holy Spirit says, that the honor of the Father
is the glory of the Son, and the dishonor of the Father
is the shame of the Son.<a id="FNanchor_905" href="#Footnote_905" class="fnanchor">[905]</a> And St. Augustine
says, that Jesus preserved the body of Mary from
being corrupted after death, since it would have dishonored
him if corruption had destroyed that virginal
flesh from which he had clothed himself.<a id="FNanchor_906" href="#Footnote_906" class="fnanchor">[906]</a> Corruption
is the reproach of the human condition, from which
the nature of Mary was exempted, in order that Jesus
might be exempt from it, for the flesh of Jesus is the
flesh of Mary. Now, if it were a dishonor for Jesus
Christ to be born of a mother whose body was subject
to the corruption of the flesh, how much greater
would be the shame had he been born of a mother
whose soul was corrupted by sin! Moreover, as it is
true that the flesh of Jesus is the same as that of
Mary, in such a manner (as the saint himself here<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_349"></a>[349]</span>
adds) that the flesh of the Saviour after his resurrection
was the very same which he received from his
mother;<a id="FNanchor_907" href="#Footnote_907" class="fnanchor">[907]</a> therefore St. Arnold of Carnotensis says:
The flesh of Mary and of Christ is one, and hence I esteem
the glory of the Son to be not so much common to
both as the same.<a id="FNanchor_908" href="#Footnote_908" class="fnanchor">[908]</a> Now, this being true, if the blessed
Virgin had been conceived in sin, although the Son
had not contracted the stain of sin, yet there would
always have been a certain stain from the union of
himself with flesh once infected by guilt, a vessel of
uncleanness, and a slave of Lucifer.</p>

<p>Mary was not only the mother, but a worthy mother
of the Saviour. Thus all the holy Fathers name her.
St. Bernard says: Thou alone hast been found worthy,
that in thy virginal hall the King of kings should
choose his first mansion.<a id="FNanchor_909" href="#Footnote_909" class="fnanchor">[909]</a> And St. Thomas of Villanova:
Before she had conceived she was fitted to
be the mother of God.<a id="FNanchor_910" href="#Footnote_910" class="fnanchor">[910]</a> The holy Church herself attests
that the Virgin merited to be the mother of
Jesus Christ.<a id="FNanchor_911" href="#Footnote_911" class="fnanchor">[911]</a> Explaining which passage, St. Thomas<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_350"></a>[350]</span>
of Aquinas remarks, that Mary could not merit the
incarnation of the Word, but with divine grace she
merited such perfection as would render her worthy
to become the mother of a God;<a id="FNanchor_912" href="#Footnote_912" class="fnanchor">[912]</a> as St. Peter Damian
also writes: Her singular sanctity merited (out
of pure grace) that she should alone be judged worthy
to receive a God.<a id="FNanchor_913" href="#Footnote_913" class="fnanchor">[913]</a></p>

<p>Now, this being granted, that Mary was a mother
worthy of God, what excellency and what perfection,
says St. Thomas of Villanova, were befitting her!<a id="FNanchor_914" href="#Footnote_914" class="fnanchor">[914]</a>
The same angelic Doctor declares, that when God
elects any one to a certain dignity, he also fits him for
it; hence, he says, that God having chosen Mary for
his mother, certainly rendered her worthy of it by his
grace, according to what the angel said to her: “Thou
hast found grace with God, behold thou shalt conceive,
etc.”<a id="FNanchor_915" href="#Footnote_915" class="fnanchor">[915]</a> And from this the saint infers that the Virgin
never committed any actual sin, not even a venial sin;
otherwise, he says, she would not have been a worthy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_351"></a>[351]</span>
mother of Jesus Christ, since the ignominy of the
mother would also be that of the Son, if his mother
had been a sinner.<a id="FNanchor_916" href="#Footnote_916" class="fnanchor">[916]</a> Now, if Mary, by committing
only one venial offence, which does not deprive the
soul of divine grace, might be said not to have been
a worthy mother of God, how much more if she had
been stained with original sin, which would have rendered
her an enemy of God, and a slave of the devil!
Therefore St. Augustine says in a celebrated passage
of his writings, that speaking of Mary, he would
make no mention of sins, for the honor of that Lord
whom she merited for her Son, and through whom she
had the grace to conquer sin in every way.<a id="FNanchor_917" href="#Footnote_917" class="fnanchor">[917]</a></p>

<p>We should therefore hold it for certain, that the
incarnate Word selected for himself a befitting mother,
and one of whom he need not be ashamed, as St. Peter
Damian expresses it.<a id="FNanchor_918" href="#Footnote_918" class="fnanchor">[918]</a> And also St. Proculus: He
inhabited those bowels which he had created, so as to
be free from any mark of infamy.<a id="FNanchor_919" href="#Footnote_919" class="fnanchor">[919]</a> Jesus felt it no
reproach to hear himself called by the Jews the son<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_352"></a>[352]</span>
of a poor woman: “Is not his mother called Mary?”<a id="FNanchor_920" href="#Footnote_920" class="fnanchor">[920]</a>
for he came on earth to give an example of humility
and patience. But on the other hand, it would doubtless
have been a reproach to him if it could have been
said by the demons: Was he not born from a mother
who was a sinner, and once our slave?<a id="FNanchor_921" href="#Footnote_921" class="fnanchor">[921]</a> It would
be considered most unfit that Jesus Christ should
have been born of a woman deformed and maimed
in body, or possessed by evil spirits; but how
much more unseemly that he should be born of a
woman once deformed in soul, and possessed by
Lucifer!</p>

<p>Ah, that God who is wisdom itself well knew how
to prepare upon the earth a fit dwelling for him
to inhabit: “Wisdom hath built herself a house.”<a id="FNanchor_922" href="#Footnote_922" class="fnanchor">[922]</a>
“The Most High hath sanctified his own tabernacle.”
“God will help it in the morning early.”<a id="FNanchor_923" href="#Footnote_923" class="fnanchor">[923]</a>
The Lord, says David, sanctified this his habitation <i>in
the morning early</i>; that is, from the beginning of her
life, to render her worthy of himself; for it was not
befitting a God who is holy to select a house that was
not holy: Holiness becometh thy house: “Domum
tuum decet sanctitudo.”<a id="FNanchor_924" href="#Footnote_924" class="fnanchor">[924]</a> And if he himself declares
that he will never enter into a malicious soul, and into<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_353"></a>[353]</span>
a body subject to sins.<a id="FNanchor_925" href="#Footnote_925" class="fnanchor">[925]</a> How can we think that the
Son of God would have chosen to inhabit the soul
and body of Mary without first sanctifying her and
preserving her from every stain of sin? for, as St.
Thomas teaches us, the eternal Word inhabited not
only the soul, but the body of Mary.<a id="FNanchor_926" href="#Footnote_926" class="fnanchor">[926]</a> The Church
also sings: Oh Lord, thou didst not shrink from the
Virgin’s womb: “Non horruisti Virginis uterum.”
Indeed, a God would have shrunk from incarnating
himself in the womb of an Agnes, of a Gertrude, of a
Theresa, since those virgins, although holy, were for a
time stained with original sin; but he did not shrink
from becoming man in the womb of Mary, because
this chosen Virgin was always pure from every guilt,
and never possessed by the infernal serpent. Hence
St. Augustine wrote: The Son of God has built himself
no house more worthy than Mary, who was
never taken by the enemy, nor robbed of her ornaments.<a id="FNanchor_927" href="#Footnote_927" class="fnanchor">[927]</a></p>

<p>On the other hand, St. Cyril of Alexandria says:
Who has ever heard of an architect building a house
for his own use and then giving the first possession of
it to his greatest enemy?<a id="FNanchor_928" href="#Footnote_928" class="fnanchor">[928]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_354"></a>[354]</span></p>

<p>Certainly our Lord, who, as St. Methodius declares,
gave us the command to honor our parents, would not
fail, when he became man, like ourselves, to observe it
himself, by bestowing on his mother every grace
and honor.<a id="FNanchor_929" href="#Footnote_929" class="fnanchor">[929]</a> Hence St. Augustine says, that we must
certainly believe that Jesus Christ preserved from corruption
the body of Mary after death, as it has been
said above; for if he had not done so, he would
not have observed the law, which, as it commands respect
to the mother, so it condemns disrespect.<a id="FNanchor_930" href="#Footnote_930" class="fnanchor">[930]</a> How
much less mindful would Jesus have been of the
honor of his mother, if he had not preserved her from
the sin of Adam! That Son would, indeed, commit
a sin, says Father Thomas d’Argentina, an Augustinian,
who, being able to preserve his mother from original
sin, should not do so; now that which would be
sinful in us, says the same author, cannot be esteemed
befitting the Son of God, namely, if he should not
have created his mother immaculate when he was able
to do so. Ah, no, exclaims Gerson, since thou, the supreme
Prince, dost wish to have a mother, honor will
certainly be due to her from thee; but this law would
not appear well fulfilled if thou shouldst permit her,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_355"></a>[355]</span>
who was to be the dwelling of all purity, to fall into
the abomination of original sin.<a id="FNanchor_931" href="#Footnote_931" class="fnanchor">[931]</a></p>

<p>Moreover, the divine Son, as we know, came into
the world to redeem Mary before all others, as we
read in St. Bernardine of Sienna.<a id="FNanchor_932" href="#Footnote_932" class="fnanchor">[932]</a> And as there
are two modes of redeeming, as St. Augustine teaches,
one by raising the fallen; the other, by preventing
from falling;<a id="FNanchor_933" href="#Footnote_933" class="fnanchor">[933]</a> doubtless, the latter is the most noble.
More nobly, says St. Antoninus, is he redeemed who
is prevented from falling, than he who is raised after
falling;<a id="FNanchor_934" href="#Footnote_934" class="fnanchor">[934]</a> because in this way is avoided the injury or
stain that the soul always contracts by a fall. Therefore
we ought to believe that Mary was redeemed in
the nobler manner, as became the mother of a God,
as St. Bonaventure expresses it; for Frassen proves
the sermon on the assumption to have been written by
that holy doctor.<a id="FNanchor_935" href="#Footnote_935" class="fnanchor">[935]</a> We must believe that by a new
mode of sanctification the Holy Spirit redeemed her at
the first moment of her conception, and preserved her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_356"></a>[356]</span>
by a special grace from original sin, which was not in
her, but would have been in her.<a id="FNanchor_936" href="#Footnote_936" class="fnanchor">[936]</a> On this subject
Cardinal Cusano has elegantly written: Others have
had a deliverer, but the holy Virgin had a predeliverer;<a id="FNanchor_937" href="#Footnote_937" class="fnanchor">[937]</a>
others have had a Redeemer to deliver them from
sin already contracted, but the holy Virgin had a Redeemer
who, because he was her Son, prevented her
from contracting sin.</p>

<p>In a word, to conclude this point, Hugo of St. Victor
says, the tree is known by its fruit. If the Lamb
was always immaculate, always immaculate must the
mother also have been.<a id="FNanchor_938" href="#Footnote_938" class="fnanchor">[938]</a> Hence this same doctor saluted
Mary by calling her: The worthy mother of a
worthy Son: “O digna digni.” By which he meant
to say, that none but Mary was the worthy mother of
such a Son, and that none but Jesus was the worthy
Son of such a mother.<a id="FNanchor_939" href="#Footnote_939" class="fnanchor">[939]</a> Therefore let us say with St.
Ildephonsus: Give suck, then, oh Mary, give suck to thy
Creator; give suck to him who created thee, and hath
made thee so pure and perfect that thou hast merited
that he should receive from thee the human nature.<a id="FNanchor_940" href="#Footnote_940" class="fnanchor">[940]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_357"></a>[357]</span></p>

<p><i>Third Point.</i>—If, then, it became the Father to
preserve Mary as his daughter from sin, and the Son
because she was his mother, it also became the Holy
Spirit to preserve her as his spouse. Mary, says St.
Augustine, was the only one who merited to be called
the mother and spouse of God.<a id="FNanchor_941" href="#Footnote_941" class="fnanchor">[941]</a> For, as St. Anselm
affirms, the Holy Spirit came bodily upon Mary and
rested in her, enriching her with grace beyond all
creatures, dwelt in her, and made his spouse queen of
heaven and of earth.<a id="FNanchor_942" href="#Footnote_942" class="fnanchor">[942]</a> As the saint expresses it: He
was with her really, as to the effect, since he came to
form from her immaculate body the immaculate body
of Jesus Christ, as the archangel predicted: The
Holy Ghost shall come upon thee.<a id="FNanchor_943" href="#Footnote_943" class="fnanchor">[943]</a> For this reason,
says St. Thomas, Mary is called the temple of the
Lord, the sanctuary of the Holy Spirit, because, by
the operation of the Holy Spirit, she was made mother
of the incarnate Word.<a id="FNanchor_944" href="#Footnote_944" class="fnanchor">[944]</a></p>

<p>Now, if an excellent painter were allowed to choose
a bride as beautiful or as deformed as he himself
might paint her, how great would be his solicitude to
make her as beautiful as possible! Who, then, will
say that the Holy Spirit has not dealt thus with Mary,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_358"></a>[358]</span>
and that, having it in his power to make this his spouse
as beautiful as it became her to be, he has not done so?
Yes, thus it was fitting he should do, and thus he did,
as the Lord himself attested when praising Mary; he
said to her: “Thou art all fair, oh my love; and there
is not a spot in thee;”<a id="FNanchor_945" href="#Footnote_945" class="fnanchor">[945]</a> which words, as we learn
from à Lapide, St. Ildephonsus, and St. Thomas, explain
as properly to be understood of Mary. St.
Bernardine of Sienna,<a id="FNanchor_946" href="#Footnote_946" class="fnanchor">[946]</a> and St. Lawrence Justinian,<a id="FNanchor_947" href="#Footnote_947" class="fnanchor">[947]</a>
also declare that the passage above quoted is precisely
to be understood of her immaculate conception; hence
the Idiot says: Thou art all fair, oh most glorious
Virgin, not in part, but wholly; and the stain of sin,
whether mortal, or venial, or original, is not upon
thee.<a id="FNanchor_948" href="#Footnote_948" class="fnanchor">[948]</a></p>

<p>The Holy Spirit signified the same thing, when he
called this his spouse: “A garden inclosed, a fountain
sealed up.”<a id="FNanchor_949" href="#Footnote_949" class="fnanchor">[949]</a> Mary, says St. Jerome, was properly
this inclosed garden and sealed fountain; for the
enemies never entered to harm her, but she was always
uninjured, remaining holy in soul and body<a id="FNanchor_950" href="#Footnote_950" class="fnanchor">[950]</a>. And in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_359"></a>[359]</span>
like manner St. Bernard said, addressing the blessed
Virgin: Thou art an inclosed garden, where the sinner’s
hand never entered to rob it of its flowers.<a id="FNanchor_951" href="#Footnote_951" class="fnanchor">[951]</a></p>

<p>We know that this divine spouse loved Mary more
than all the other saints and angels united, as Father
Suarez, St. Lawrence Justinian, and others affirm. He
loved her from the beginning, and exalted her in sanctity
above all creatures, as David expresses it: “The
foundations thereof are in the holy mountains; the
Lord loveth the gates of Sion above all the tabernacles
of Jacob.... This man is born in her, and the
Highest himself hath founded her.”<a id="FNanchor_952" href="#Footnote_952" class="fnanchor">[952]</a> All which words
signify that Mary was holy from her conception. The
same thing is signified by what the Holy Spirit himself
says in another place: “Many daughters have gathered
together riches; thou hast surpassed them all.”<a id="FNanchor_953" href="#Footnote_953" class="fnanchor">[953]</a>
If Mary has surpassed all in the riches of grace, she
then possessed original justice, as Adam and the
angels had it. “There are young maidens without
number: one is my dove, my perfect one (the Hebrew
reads, my uncorrupted, my immaculate); she is the
only one of her mother.”<a id="FNanchor_954" href="#Footnote_954" class="fnanchor">[954]</a> All just souls are children<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_360"></a>[360]</span>
of divine grace; but among these, Mary was the <i>Dove</i>
without the bitter gall of sin, the <i>Perfect One</i> without
the stain of original sin, the <i>one</i> conceived in grace.</p>

<p>The angel, therefore, before she was mother of God,
already found her full of grace, and thus saluted her:
Hail, full of grace: “Ave gratia plena.” Commenting
upon which words, Sophronius writes, that to the
other saints grace is given in part, but to the Virgin
it was given in fulness.<a id="FNanchor_955" href="#Footnote_955" class="fnanchor">[955]</a> So that, as St. Thomas
says, grace not only made the soul, but also the flesh
of Mary holy, that with it the Virgin might clothe
the eternal Word.<a id="FNanchor_956" href="#Footnote_956" class="fnanchor">[956]</a> Now by all this we are to understand,
as Peter of Celles remarks, that Mary, from
the moment of her conception, was enriched by the
Holy Spirit, and filled with divine grace.<a id="FNanchor_957" href="#Footnote_957" class="fnanchor">[957]</a> Hence, as
St. Peter Damian says: She being elected and pre-elected
by God, was borne off by the Holy Spirit for
himself.<a id="FNanchor_958" href="#Footnote_958" class="fnanchor">[958]</a> Borne off, as the saint expresses it, to explain
the swiftness of the Divine Spirit in making her his
spouse, before Lucifer should take possession of her.</p>

<p>I will at length close this discourse, in which I have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_361"></a>[361]</span>
been more diffuse than in the others, because our little
congregation has for its principal protectress the most
holy Virgin Mary, precisely under this title of her immaculate
conception. I will close, I say, by declaring
in a few words what are the reasons which make
me certain, and which, as I think, should make
every one certain of this pious sentiment, so glorious
to the divine mother—that she was free from original
sin.</p>

<p>There are many doctors who maintain that Mary
was even exempt from contracting the debt of sin;
such as Cardinal Galatino,<a id="FNanchor_959" href="#Footnote_959" class="fnanchor">[959]</a> Cardinal Cusano,<a id="FNanchor_960" href="#Footnote_960" class="fnanchor">[960]</a> De
Ponte,<a id="FNanchor_961" href="#Footnote_961" class="fnanchor">[961]</a> Salasar,<a id="FNanchor_962" href="#Footnote_962" class="fnanchor">[962]</a>
    Catherinus,<a id="FNanchor_963" href="#Footnote_963" class="fnanchor">[963]</a> Novarino,<a id="FNanchor_964" href="#Footnote_964" class="fnanchor">[964]</a>
    Viva,<a id="FNanchor_965" href="#Footnote_965" class="fnanchor">[965]</a>
De Lugo, Egidius, Richelius, and others. Now this
opinion is very probable; for if it is true that in the
will of Adam, as head of the human race, were included
the wills of all, as Gonet,<a id="FNanchor_966" href="#Footnote_966" class="fnanchor">[966]</a> Habert,<a id="FNanchor_967" href="#Footnote_967" class="fnanchor">[967]</a> and
others hold it to be probable, on the testimony of these
words of St. Paul: “In whom (Adam) all have sinned.”<a id="FNanchor_968" href="#Footnote_968" class="fnanchor">[968]</a>
If this, then, is probable, it is also probable
that Mary did not contract the debt of sin; for God
having greatly distinguished her in the order of grace
from the rest of mankind, it should be piously believed,
that in the will of Adam, the will of Mary was not
included.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_362"></a>[362]</span></p>

<p>This opinion is only probable, but I adhere to it, as
being more glorious for my Lady. But, then, I hold
it for certain that Mary has not contracted the sin of
Adam, as Cardinal Everard,<a id="FNanchor_969" href="#Footnote_969" class="fnanchor">[969]</a> Duval,<a id="FNanchor_970" href="#Footnote_970" class="fnanchor">[970]</a>
    Raynauld,<a id="FNanchor_971" href="#Footnote_971" class="fnanchor">[971]</a>
Lossada,<a id="FNanchor_972" href="#Footnote_972" class="fnanchor">[972]</a> Viva,<a id="FNanchor_973" href="#Footnote_973" class="fnanchor">[973]</a> and many others hold it for certain,
and even proximately definable as an article of faith, as
they express it. I omit, however, the revelations that
confirm this opinion; especially those made to St. Bridget,
approved by Cardinal Torrecremata, and by four
supreme Pontiffs, and which we read in the sixth book
of the above-mentioned revelations, in various places.<a id="FNanchor_974" href="#Footnote_974" class="fnanchor">[974]</a>
But I can by no means omit to mention here the opinions
of the holy Fathers on this point, in order to prove how
uniform they have been in conceding this privilege to the
divine mother. St. Ambrose says: Receive me not from
Sarah, but from Mary, as an uncorrupted Virgin, a
Virgin through grace preserved pure from every stain
of sin.<a id="FNanchor_975" href="#Footnote_975" class="fnanchor">[975]</a> Origen, speaking of Mary, says: Neither was
she infected by the breath of the venomous serpent.<a id="FNanchor_976" href="#Footnote_976" class="fnanchor">[976]</a>
And St. Ephrem: She is immaculate, and remote from
every taint of sin.<a id="FNanchor_977" href="#Footnote_977" class="fnanchor">[977]</a> St. Augustine, meditating on the
words of the angel, “Hail, full of grace,” says: By<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_363"></a>[363]</span>
these words he shows her to be entirely (note, entirely)
excluded from the wrath of the first sentence, and
restored to the full grace of benediction.<a id="FNanchor_978" href="#Footnote_978" class="fnanchor">[978]</a> St. Jerome:
That cloud was never in darkness, but always in the
light.<a id="FNanchor_979" href="#Footnote_979" class="fnanchor">[979]</a> St. Cyprian, on Psalm lxxvii., or whoever may
be the author of that treatise, says: Neither did justice
suffer that vessel of election to be open to common
injuries, for, being far exalted above others, she was a
partaker of their nature, but not of their sin.<a id="FNanchor_980" href="#Footnote_980" class="fnanchor">[980]</a> St.
Amphilochius also says: He who created the first
virgin without reproach, also created the second without
stain or crime.<a id="FNanchor_981" href="#Footnote_981" class="fnanchor">[981]</a> Sophronius: Therefore she is
called the immaculate Virgin, because she was in no
manner corrupted.<a id="FNanchor_982" href="#Footnote_982" class="fnanchor">[982]</a> St. Ildephonsus: It is certain
that she was exempt from original sin.<a id="FNanchor_983" href="#Footnote_983" class="fnanchor">[983]</a> St. John of
Damascus: To this paradise the serpent had no entrance.<a id="FNanchor_984" href="#Footnote_984" class="fnanchor">[984]</a>
St. Peter Damian: The flesh of the Virgin,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_364"></a>[364]</span>
received from Adam, was free from Adam’s taint of
sin.<a id="FNanchor_985" href="#Footnote_985" class="fnanchor">[985]</a> St. Bruno: This is that uncorrupted earth
which the Lord has blessed, and hence she is pure
from all contagion of sin.<a id="FNanchor_986" href="#Footnote_986" class="fnanchor">[986]</a> St. Bonaventure, also:
Our Lady was full of preventing grace in her sanctification,
namely, of grace preservative against the defilement
of original sin.<a id="FNanchor_987" href="#Footnote_987" class="fnanchor">[987]</a> St. Bernardine of Sienna:
For it is not to be believed that the Son of God himself
would choose to be born of a virgin, and assume
her flesh, if she were defiled in any way with original
sin.<a id="FNanchor_988" href="#Footnote_988" class="fnanchor">[988]</a> St. Lawrence Justinian: From her conception
she was prevented with blessing.<a id="FNanchor_989" href="#Footnote_989" class="fnanchor">[989]</a> So the Idiot, upon
those words, Thou hast found grace, “Invenisti
gratiam,” says: Thou hast found peculiar grace, oh
most sweet Virgin, for thou wast preserved from the
original stain, &amp;c.<a id="FNanchor_990" href="#Footnote_990" class="fnanchor">[990]</a> And many other Doctors express
the same.</p>

<p>But there are two arguments which conclusively<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_365"></a>[365]</span>
prove the truth of this opinion. The first is the universal
consent of the faithful on this point. Father
Egidius, of the Presentation, asserts that all the religious
orders follow the same opinion:<a id="FNanchor_991" href="#Footnote_991" class="fnanchor">[991]</a> and although
in the order of St. Dominic, says a modern author,
there are ninety-two writers who are of the contrary
opinion, yet one hundred and thirty-six are of ours.
But what should especially persuade us that our pious
opinion is conformable to the common opinion of
Catholics, is the declaration of Pope Alexander VII., in
the celebrated bull, “Sollicitudo omnium ecclesiarum,”
issued in the year 1661, namely: “This devotion
and worship to the mother of God again increased
and was propagated, ... so that the universities having
embraced this opinion (that is, the pious one), almost
all Catholics embrace it.”<a id="FNanchor_992" href="#Footnote_992" class="fnanchor">[992]</a> And, in fact, this opinion is
defended by the universities of the Sorbonne, of Alcala,
of Salamanca, of Coimbra, of Cologne, of Mayence,
and of Naples, and by many others, in which every one
who graduates binds himself by an oath to the defence
of the immaculate Mary. The learned Petavius
rests his proof of the immaculate conception mainly
upon this argument of the common consent of the faithful.<a id="FNanchor_993" href="#Footnote_993" class="fnanchor">[993]</a>
Which argument, writes the most learned Bishop
Julius Torni, cannot fail to convince; for, in fact, if<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_366"></a>[366]</span>
nothing else, the common consent of the faithful renders
us certain of the sanctification of Mary in the
womb, and of the glorious assumption of her soul and
body into heaven; why, then, should not this same
common sentiment render us certain of her immaculate
conception?<a id="FNanchor_994" href="#Footnote_994" class="fnanchor">[994]</a></p>

<p>By another reason, still stronger than the first, we are
assured of the truth of the fact, that the Virgin is exempt
from the Original stain, namely, the festival instituted
by the universal Church in honor of her Immaculate
Conception. And with regard to this I see, on the
one hand, that the Church celebrates the first moment
when her soul was created and infused into the body,
as Alexander VII. declares in the bull above quoted,
in which it is expressed that the Church prescribes the
same veneration for the conception of Mary, as the
pious opinion concedes to her, which holds her to be
conceived without original sin. On the other hand, I
know it to be certain that the Church cannot honor
any thing unholy, according to the decrees of the
sovereign pontiffs St. Leo<a id="FNanchor_995" href="#Footnote_995" class="fnanchor">[995]</a> and St. Eusebius: “In the
Apostolic See the Catholic religion has always been
preserved pure from stain.<a id="FNanchor_996" href="#Footnote_996" class="fnanchor">[996]</a>” And all the theologians,
including St. Augustine,<a id="FNanchor_997" href="#Footnote_997" class="fnanchor">[997]</a> St. Bernard, and St. Thomas,
teach the same thing. The latter makes use of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_367"></a>[367]</span>
argument of the festival of her birth, instituted by the
Church, to prove that Mary was sanctified before birth;
and therefore says: The Church celebrates the nativity
of the blessed Virgin; but no feast is celebrated
in the Church except in honor of some saint; therefore
the blessed Virgin was sanctified in the womb.<a id="FNanchor_998" href="#Footnote_998" class="fnanchor">[998]</a>
Now if it is certain, as the angelic Doctor declares,
that Mary was sanctified in the womb, because for
this reason the holy Church celebrates her birth;
why should we not then hold it for certain that Mary
was preserved from original sin from the first moment
of her conception, now that we know that in this sense
the Church herself celebrates the festival of it?<a id="FNanchor_999" href="#Footnote_999" class="fnanchor">[999]</a> In
confirmation, too, of this great privilege of Mary, it is
well known what numerous and remarkable graces our
Lord has been pleased to dispense daily in the kingdom
of Naples, by means of the little pictures of the
Virgin of the Immaculate Conception. I could relate
many that took place under the eyes of the fathers of
our own congregation; but I will relate only two,
which are truly wonderful.</p>

<h5>EXAMPLE.</h5>

<p>There came a woman to one of the houses of our
little congregation, in this kingdom, to tell one of the
fathers that her husband had not been to confession<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_368"></a>[368]</span>
for many years, and that she did not know how to bring
him back to his duties, for whenever she spoke to him
of confession he beat her. The father told her to
give him a little picture of Mary immaculate. Evening
came, and the woman again begged her husband
to go to confession; but the man being deaf as before,
she gave him the picture. He had no sooner received it
than he said: “When will you take me to confession,
for I am ready?” The wife, at that sudden change,
wept for joy. In the morning he came to our church,
and when the father asked him how long it was since
he had been to confession, he answered: “Twenty-eight
years.” “And what has brought you to confession
this morning?” said the father. “Father,”
he said, “I was obstinate, but yesterday my wife gave
me a picture of the Madonna, and immediately I felt
my heart changed, so that last night appeared to me
a thousand years long, and I thought the day would
never come when I might go to confession.” He
made his confession with great compunction, changed
his life, and continued for a long time to go often to
confession to the same father.</p>

<p>In another place, in the diocese of Salerno, during
one of our missions, there was a certain man who had
a great enmity against one who had offended him. One
of our fathers spoke to him, and exhorted him to pardon
the offence. “Father, have you ever seen me at
the sermon? No, you have not, and for this reason I
stay away: I see that I am damned, but I do not
wish it otherwise, I must have revenge.” The father<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_369"></a>[369]</span>
made every effort to convert him, but finding that he
was wasting his words, “Take,” he said to him, “this
little picture of the Madonna.” “Of what use,” said
he, “is this picture?” But he took it, and as if
he had never refused to pardon his enemy, he said to
the missionary, “Father, do you wish any thing more
than reconciliation? for that I am ready.” The next
morning was appointed for the reconciliation; but
when the morning came, his mind was changed, and
he would do nothing. The father offered him another
picture. He did not wish for it, and took it unwillingly;
but behold, no sooner had he taken it, than he immediately
said, “Let us be reconciled: where is Mastrodatti?”
He then forgave his enemy, and afterwards
made his confession.</p>

<h5>PRAYER.</h5>

<p>Ah, my immaculate Lady, I rejoice with thee,
seeing thee endowed with so great purity. I give
thanks, and make the resolution always to give thanks
to our common Creator, for having preserved thee
from every stain of sin, as I certainly believe; and to
defend this great and peculiar privilege of thy immaculate
conception I am ready, and swear to give
even my life if it is necessary. I wish that all the
world might know thee, and acknowledge thee for
that beautiful <i>aurora</i>, which was always resplendent
with the divine light; that chosen <i>ark</i> of salvation,
safe from the common shipwreck of sin; for that <i>perfect
and immaculate dove</i>, as thy divine spouse declared<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_370"></a>[370]</span>
thee; that <i>inclosed garden</i>, which was the delight
of God; that <i>fountain sealed up</i>, which the
enemy never entered to trouble; finally, that <i>spotless
lily</i>, which thou art, springing up among the thorns of
the children of Adam; for whereas all are born defiled
with original sin, and enemies of God, thou wast born
pure, all spotless, and in all things a friend of thy
Creator.</p>

<p>Let me, then, also praise thee as thy God himself
hath praised thee when he said: Thou art all fair, and
there is not a spot in thee: “Tota pulchra es et macula
non est in te.” Oh most pure dove, all white,
all beautiful, and always the friend of God: “O quam
pulchra es, amica mea, quam pulchra es.” Oh most
sweet, most amiable, immaculate Mary, thou who art
so beautiful in the eyes of our Lord, do not disdain
to look with thy pitying eye upon the loathsome
wounds of my soul. Behold me, pity me, and heal
me. Oh powerful magnet of hearts, draw also my
miserable heart to thee. Thou who even from the
first moment of thy life wast pure and beautiful in the
sight of God, have pity on me, for I was not only born
in sin, but after baptism, I again have defiled my soul
with sin. Will God, who hath chosen thee for his
child, his mother, and his spouse, and therefore hath
preserved thee free from every stain, refuse any grace
to thee? Virgin immaculate, you must save me; I
will say to thee with St. Philip Neri, make me always
to remember thee, and do not forget me. It seems to
me a thousand years before I shall go to behold thy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_371"></a>[371]</span>
beauty in paradise, to praise and love thee more, my
mother, my queen, my beloved, most lovely, most
sweet, most pure, immaculate Mary. Amen.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" id="DISCOURSE_II">DISCOURSE II.<br>
<span class="smaller">ON THE BIRTH OF MARY.</span></h4>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>Mary was born a saint, and a great saint, for great was the
grace with which our Lord enriched her from the beginning,
and great was the fidelity with which Mary at once corresponded
with it.</i></p>

</div>

<p>Men are accustomed to celebrate the birth of their
children with joy and feasting; but rather ought they
to weep and give signs of grief and mourning, considering
that these are born, not only destitute of merits
and of reason, but moreover infected by sin and children
of wrath, and therefore condemned to misery and
death. But with reason do we celebrate, with feasts
and universal praise, the birth of our infant Mary, for
she came into this world an infant in age, it is true,
but great in merits and in virtues. Mary was born a
saint, and a great saint. But to conceive the degree
of sanctity in which she was born, we must call to
mind, in the first place, how great was the first grace
with which God enriched Mary; and in the second,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_372"></a>[372]</span>
with how great fidelity Mary at once corresponded
with God.</p>

<p><i>First Point.</i>—Commencing with the first point, it
is certain that the soul of Mary was the most beautiful
soul that God ever created; indeed, next to the
incarnation of the Word, this work was the greatest
and most worthy of himself that the Omnipotent could
accomplish in this world—a work, as St. Peter Damian
terms it, which God alone excels: “Opus quod
solus Deus supergreditur.” Hence it was that the
divine grace did not descend upon Mary in drops as
upon the other saints, but as David predicted: Like
rain upon the fleece: “Sicut pluvia in vellus.”<a id="FNanchor_1000" href="#Footnote_1000" class="fnanchor">[1000]</a> The
soul of Mary was like wool, that happily imbibed all
that great shower of graces without losing a drop.
The holy Virgin, says St. Basil, drew into herself all
the graces of the Holy Spirit.<a id="FNanchor_1001" href="#Footnote_1001" class="fnanchor">[1001]</a> Hence she herself
said by the mouth of Ecclesiasticus: My abode is in
the fulness of saints: “In plenitudine Sanctorum detentio
mea;”<a id="FNanchor_1002" href="#Footnote_1002" class="fnanchor">[1002]</a> which St. Bonaventure thus explains:
I have in fulness all that the other saints have in
part;<a id="FNanchor_1003" href="#Footnote_1003" class="fnanchor">[1003]</a> and St. Vincent Ferrer, speaking especially of
the sanctity of Mary before her birth, said, that she
surpassed all the saints and angels in sanctity.<a id="FNanchor_1004" href="#Footnote_1004" class="fnanchor">[1004]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_373"></a>[373]</span></p>

<p>The grace of the blessed Virgin surpassed the grace
not only of each saint in particular, but of all the saints
and angels together, as the most learned Father Francis
Pepe, of the Society of Jesus, proves, in his admirable
work on the grandeur of Jesus and Mary;<a id="FNanchor_1005" href="#Footnote_1005" class="fnanchor">[1005]</a> and
he asserts that this opinion, so glorious for our queen,
is now common and established among modern theologians,
as Carthagena, Suarez, Spinelli, Recupito,
Guerra, and others, who have avowedly examined it,
which was not done by the ancients; and he further
relates, that the divine mother sent Father Martin
Guttierez to thank Father Suarez in her name for
having, with so much courage, defended this most
probable opinion, which Father Segneri asserts, in his
work entitled “The Servant of Mary,” was maintained
by the common consent of the Faculty of
Salamanca.</p>

<p>Now if this opinion is universal and certain, the
other opinion is also very probable, namely, that Mary
received from the first moment of her immaculate conception
this grace, superior to the grace of all the
saints and angels together. This the same Father
Suarez powerfully defends, and Father Spinelli, Recupito,<a id="FNanchor_1006" href="#Footnote_1006" class="fnanchor">[1006]</a>
and Colombiere,<a id="FNanchor_1007" href="#Footnote_1007" class="fnanchor">[1007]</a> follow him. But besides the
authority of theologians, there are yet two great and
convincing reasons sufficient to prove the above-mentioned
opinion. The first reason is, that Mary was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_374"></a>[374]</span>
chosen by God to be the mother of the divine Word;
hence blessed Denis the Carthusian says, that having
been elected to an order superior to all creatures (for
in a certain sense the dignity of mother of God, as
Father Suarez affirms, belongs to the order of the
hypostatic union), gifts of a superior order were justly
bestowed upon her from the beginning of her life,
so that her graces far exceeded those granted to all
other creatures. And, indeed, it cannot be doubted,
that at the same time, when in the divine decrees the
person of the eternal Word was predestined to become
man, a mother was also destined for him, from
whom he was to take the human nature, and this was
our infant Mary. Now St. Thomas teaches that the
Lord gives to every one grace proportioned to that
dignity for which he destines him;<a id="FNanchor_1008" href="#Footnote_1008" class="fnanchor">[1008]</a> St. Paul taught
this before, when he said: “Who also hath made us
fit ministers of the New Testament;”<a id="FNanchor_1009" href="#Footnote_1009" class="fnanchor">[1009]</a> signifying to
us that the Apostles received from God gifts proportioned
to the great office to which they were elected.
St. Bernardine of Sienna adds, that when a man is
chosen by God for any state, he not only receives the
dispositions requisite for that, but also the gifts necessary
to fill the office in a becoming manner.<a id="FNanchor_1010" href="#Footnote_1010" class="fnanchor">[1010]</a> Now<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_375"></a>[375]</span>
if Mary was chosen to be mother of God, it was meet
that God should adorn her, even from the first moment,
with an immense grace, and of an order superior
to the grace of all other men and angels; it being
requisite that the grace should correspond with the
most high and immense dignity to which God exalted
her; in which opinion all theologians agree with St.
Thomas, who says: The Virgin was elected to be
the mother of God, and therefore there can be no
doubt that God, by his grace, rendered her fit for it.<a id="FNanchor_1011" href="#Footnote_1011" class="fnanchor">[1011]</a>
Hence Mary, before being made mother of God, was
adorned with a sanctity so perfect, that it rendered
her fit for this great dignity. In the blessed Virgin,
therefore, says the holy doctor, was a perfection, as it
were preparative, by which she was fitted to become
the mother of Christ; and this was the perfection of
sanctification.<a id="FNanchor_1012" href="#Footnote_1012" class="fnanchor">[1012]</a></p>

<p>And St. Thomas had before said, that Mary was
called full of grace, not on account of the degree of
grace, since she had not grace in its highest possible
degree; for even the habitual grace of Jesus Christ
(as the same doctor says) was not the highest possible,
so that God, by his absolute power, could not make it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_376"></a>[376]</span>
greater; although it was grace sufficient to correspond
to the end for which his humanity was destined by
the divine Wisdom, that is, for the union with the
person of the Word.<a id="FNanchor_1013" href="#Footnote_1013" class="fnanchor">[1013]</a> The divine power, although it
may form something greater and better than the
habitual grace of Christ, yet could make nothing
that should be destined to any thing greater than
the personal union of the only begotten Son of the
Father, to which union such a measure of grace would
sufficiently correspond, according to the idea of divine
wisdom.<a id="FNanchor_1014" href="#Footnote_1014" class="fnanchor">[1014]</a></p>

<p>The same angelic Doctor teaches, that the divine
power is so great, that however much it gives, there
always remains something more to give; and although
the natural power of the creature in receiving is in
itself limited, so that it can be entirely filled, yet the
power of its obedience to the divine will is unlimited,
and God can always increase its fulness by making it
more capable of receiving;<a id="FNanchor_1015" href="#Footnote_1015" class="fnanchor">[1015]</a> and hence, to return to
our proposition, St. Thomas declares, that the blessed
Virgin, although not full of grace, in respect to absolute<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_377"></a>[377]</span>
grace; yet is called full of grace in respect to
herself, since she possessed a grace immense, sufficient,
and corresponding to her great dignity, which
rendered her fit to become the mother of a God.<a id="FNanchor_1016" href="#Footnote_1016" class="fnanchor">[1016]</a>
Hence the blessed Fernandez says, that the measure
by which we can know how great was the grace
communicated to Mary is her dignity as mother of
God.<a id="FNanchor_1017" href="#Footnote_1017" class="fnanchor">[1017]</a></p>

<p>Justly, then, did David say, that the foundations of
this city of God, Mary, should be laid upon the summits
of the mountains: “Fundamenta ejus in montibus
sanctis;”<a id="FNanchor_1018" href="#Footnote_1018" class="fnanchor">[1018]</a> by which we are to understand that the
beginning of the life of Mary was more exalted than
the completed lives of all the saints put together.
“The Lord loveth the gates of Sion,” the prophet
continues, “above all the tabernacles of Jacob.”<a id="FNanchor_1019" href="#Footnote_1019" class="fnanchor">[1019]</a>
And David himself gave this as the reason, namely,
that God was to make himself man in her virginal
womb: Man was born in her: “Homo natus est in
ea.” Hence it was fitting that God should give to this
Virgin, even from the first moment he created her,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_378"></a>[378]</span>
a grace corresponding with the dignity of the mother
of God.</p>

<p>Isaias foretold the same when he said, that in future
the mountain of the house of the Lord, which
was the blessed Virgin, should be prepared on the
summit of all the other mountains, and therefore all
the nations must hasten to this mountain, to receive
the divine favors.<a id="FNanchor_1020" href="#Footnote_1020" class="fnanchor">[1020]</a> St. Gregory explains this by saying:
Yea, the mountain on the top of mountains, because
the glory of Mary shone above that of all the
saints.<a id="FNanchor_1021" href="#Footnote_1021" class="fnanchor">[1021]</a> And as St. John Damascene expresses it:
The mountain which it pleased God to choose for his
habitation.<a id="FNanchor_1022" href="#Footnote_1022" class="fnanchor">[1022]</a> Mary was called a cypress, but a cypress
of Mount Sion: she was also called a cedar,
but a cedar of Lebanon; an olive-tree, but a fair
olive-tree; chosen, but chosen as the sun; for, as
the sun, says St. Peter Damian, with his light so far
exceeds all the splendor of the stars, that they are
seen no more when he appears, so the great Virgin
Mary surpasses, with her sanctity, the merits of the
whole celestial court.<a id="FNanchor_1023" href="#Footnote_1023" class="fnanchor">[1023]</a> And as St. Bernard elegantly
expresses it: Mary was so sublime in sanctity,
that none but Mary was a fitting mother of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_379"></a>[379]</span>
God. And no other Son than God was befitting
Mary.<a id="FNanchor_1024" href="#Footnote_1024" class="fnanchor">[1024]</a></p>

<p>The second argument which proves that Mary, in
the first moment of her life, was more holy than all
the saints united, is founded upon the great office
which she had from the beginning, of mediatrix of
men; for which it was requisite that she should possess
a greater treasure of grace than the whole human
race together. It is very well known how universally
this title of mediatrix is applied by theologians and
by the very holy Fathers to Mary, since by her powerful
intercession and merits <i>de congruo</i> she has obtained
salvation for all, procuring for the ruined world
the great blessing of redemption. It is said by merit
<i>de congruo</i>, because Jesus Christ alone is our mediator
by way of justice, and by merit <i>de condigno</i>, as it is
expressed by the schools, he having offered to the
eternal Father his merits, which he has accepted for
our salvation. Mary, on the contrary, is the mediatrix
of grace by way of simple intercession, and of merit
<i>de congruo</i>, she having offered to God, as the theologians
say with St. Bonaventure, her merits for the
salvation of all men; and God, through grace, has
accepted them in union with the merits of Jesus
Christ. Hence Arnold Carnotensis says: She effected
our salvation in common with Christ.<a id="FNanchor_1025" href="#Footnote_1025" class="fnanchor">[1025]</a> And<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_380"></a>[380]</span>
Richard of St. Victor, also: She desired, sought, and
obtained the salvation of all; nay, more, the salvation
of all was effected through her.<a id="FNanchor_1026" href="#Footnote_1026" class="fnanchor">[1026]</a> So that every
blessing and every gift of eternal life which each of
the saints has received from God, has been obtained
for them by Mary.</p>

<p>And it is this which the holy Church wishes us to
understand, when she honors the divine mother by applying
to her these passages of Ecclesiasticus: In me
is all grace of the way and of the truth: “In me gratia
omnis viæ et veritatis.”<a id="FNanchor_1027" href="#Footnote_1027" class="fnanchor">[1027]</a> It is said: <i>Of the way</i>, because
through Mary all graces are dispensed to those
who are still on the road to heaven: <i>Of the truth</i>, because
through Mary is given the light of truth. In me is
all hope of life and of virtue: “In me omnes spes
vitæ et virtutis.”<a id="FNanchor_1028" href="#Footnote_1028" class="fnanchor">[1028]</a> Of life, because through Mary we
hope to attain the life of grace upon earth, and of
glory in heaven; and of virtue, because through Mary
virtue is obtained, and especially the theological virtues,
which are the principal virtues of the saints. I
am the mother of fair love, and of fear, and of knowledge,
and of holy hope.<a id="FNanchor_1029" href="#Footnote_1029" class="fnanchor">[1029]</a> Mary by her intercession
obtains for her servants the gifts of divine love, of
holy fear, of celestial light, and of holy confidence.
And St. Bernard infers that it is taught by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_381"></a>[381]</span>
Church, that Mary is the universal mediatrix of our
salvation. “Extol the finder of grace, the mediatrix of
salvation, the restorer of ages.” Thus the Church
sings of her to me, and hath taught me to sing the
same.<a id="FNanchor_1030" href="#Footnote_1030" class="fnanchor">[1030]</a></p>

<p>Therefore, as St. Sophronius, Patriarch of Jerusalem,
asserts, the archangel Gabriel called her full of
grace: “Ave gratia plena;” because whilst to others,
as the saint above mentioned remarks, limited grace is
given, to Mary it was given in fulness.<a id="FNanchor_1031" href="#Footnote_1031" class="fnanchor">[1031]</a> And thus it
was ordered, as St. Basil attests, that in this way she
might become the worthy mediatrix between God
and men.<a id="FNanchor_1032" href="#Footnote_1032" class="fnanchor">[1032]</a> For if the Virgin had not been full of
divine grace, as St. Lawrence Justinian adds, how
could she be the ladder of paradise, the advocate of
the world, and the true mediatrix between God and
men?<a id="FNanchor_1033" href="#Footnote_1033" class="fnanchor">[1033]</a></p>

<p>The second argument is now made perfectly clear:
If Mary, even from the beginning, as already destined
to be the mother of the common Redeemer, received
the office of mediatrix of all men, and consequently<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_382"></a>[382]</span>
also of all the saints, it was requisite that she,
from the beginning, should have a greater grace than
all the saints had, for whom she was to intercede.
To explain myself more clearly, if by means of Mary
all men were to render themselves dear to God, it was
meet that Mary should be more holy and more dear
to God than all men united. Otherwise, how could
she intercede for all others? In order that an intercessor
may obtain from his prince favor for all his
vassals, it is absolutely necessary that he, more than
all the other vassals, should be dear to his monarch.
And Mary, therefore, concludes St. Anselm, merited
to be the worthy restorer of the ruined world, because
she was the most holy and most pure of all creatures.<a id="FNanchor_1034" href="#Footnote_1034" class="fnanchor">[1034]</a></p>

<p>Mary was, then, the mediatrix of men, some one
will say, but can she be called also the mediatrix of
angels? Many theologians are of opinion that Jesus
Christ obtained by his merits the grace of perseverance
also for the angels; so that as Jesus Christ was their
mediator <i>de condigno</i>, Mary may also be called their
mediatrix <i>de congruo</i>, having hastened by her prayers
the coming of the Redeemer. At least, having merited
<i>de congruo</i> to be chosen for the mother of the
Messias, she merited for the angels the restoration of
their seats which had been lost by the demons. Then,
at least, she merited for them this accidental glory;
hence, Richard of St. Victor says: Every creature by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_383"></a>[383]</span>
her is restored, the ruin of the angels by her is repaired,
and human nature is reconciled.<a id="FNanchor_1035" href="#Footnote_1035" class="fnanchor">[1035]</a> And St.
Anselm before had said: All things by this Virgin
are reclaimed and restored to their pristine state.<a id="FNanchor_1036" href="#Footnote_1036" class="fnanchor">[1036]</a></p>

<p>So that our heavenly child, because she was appointed
mediatrix of the world, as well as predestined
for the mother of the Redeemer, even from the first
moment of her life, received grace greater than that
of all the saints united. Hence how lovely in the
sight of heaven and earth was the beautiful soul of
that happy infant, although still inclosed in the womb
of its mother! In the eye of God she was the creature
most worthy of love, because, already full of
grace and of merit, she could, even at that time, exult
and say: When I was a little child I pleased the
Most High: “Cum essem parvula, placui Altissimo.”
And at the same time she was the creature most full of
love for God that until that time had appeared in this
world; so that Mary, had she been born immediately
after her most pure conception, would have come into
the world more rich in merits, and more holy, than all
the saints united. Now, let us consider how much
more holy she was at her birth, coming to the light
after the acquisition of those merits which she made
during the nine months that she remained in her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_384"></a>[384]</span>
mother’s womb. Let us now go on to consider the
second point, namely: how great was the fidelity with
which Mary at once corresponded with the divine
grace.</p>

<p><i>Second Point.</i>—It is not now an individual opinion
of some few divines, says a learned author,<a id="FNanchor_1037" href="#Footnote_1037" class="fnanchor">[1037]</a> it is the
opinion of the whole world, that the holy infant, when
she received sanctifying grace in the womb of St.
Anna, received at the same time the perfect use of
reason, with a great divine light corresponding to the
grace with which she was enriched. Hence we may
believe, that from the first moment when her pure soul
was united to her most pure body, she was enlightened
with divine wisdom to comprehend eternal truths, the
beauty of virtue, above all, the infinite goodness of
her God, and how much he deserves to be loved by
all men, but especially by her, on account of the peculiar
graces with which he had adorned her and distinguished
her from all creatures, preserving her from
the stain of original sin, bestowing on her a grace so
abundant, and destining her for the mother of the
Word and the queen of the universe.</p>

<p>Hence Mary, from that moment grateful to her
God, began to effect all that she could, using faithfully
all that great treasure of grace that she had received;
and wholly applying herself to please and
love the divine goodness. From that moment she
loved him with all her strength, and thus continued
to love him through all those nine months that she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_385"></a>[385]</span>
lived before her birth, in which she did not cease for
a moment to unite herself to God by fervent acts of
love. She was free from original sin, and therefore
she was also exempt from every earthly attachment,
from every irregular tendency, from every distraction,
from all strife of the senses, which could have prevented
her from advancing constantly in the divine
love. All her senses united with her blessed spirit in
drawing her near to God. Hence her pure soul, freed
from every hindrance, without lingering, always rose to
God, always loved him, and always increased in love to
him. Therefore she called herself a plane-tree planted
by the waters: “Quasi platanus exaltata sum juxta
aquam;”<a id="FNanchor_1038" href="#Footnote_1038" class="fnanchor">[1038]</a> for she, indeed, was that noble tree of God
that always grew beside the stream of divine grace.
She also called herself a vine: As the vine I have
brought forth a pleasant odor: “Ego quasi vitis fructificavi
suavitatem odoris;”<a id="FNanchor_1039" href="#Footnote_1039" class="fnanchor">[1039]</a> not only because she
was so humble in the eyes of the world, but also because,
as the vine never ceases to grow: “Vitis nullo
fine crescit:” according to the Proverb, so the most
holy Virgin always increased in perfection. The growth
of other trees, as the orange, mulberry, pear, &amp;c., is
determinate, but the vine always increases, and increases
in proportion to the height of the tree by which it is
supported. Hail, oh vine, always vigorous! thus St.
Gregory Thaumaturgus salutes her;<a id="FNanchor_1040" href="#Footnote_1040" class="fnanchor">[1040]</a> for she was
always united to her God, who was her only support.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_386"></a>[386]</span>
Thus it was of her that the Holy Spirit spoke, when
he said: Who is this that cometh up from the desert
flowing with delights, leaning on her beloved?<a id="FNanchor_1041" href="#Footnote_1041" class="fnanchor">[1041]</a> Commenting
on this, St. Ambrose says: Who is this that,
accompanied by the divine Word, increases like the
vine supported by a lofty tree?<a id="FNanchor_1042" href="#Footnote_1042" class="fnanchor">[1042]</a></p>

<p>Many grave theologians teach, that the soul which
possesses a habit of virtue, whenever she corresponds
faithfully with the actual graces which she afterwards
receives from God, always produces an act equal in
intensity to the habit she possesses; so that each time
she acquires a new and double merit, equal to the aggregate
of all the merits before acquired. This increase,
as they say, was granted to the angels in the time of
their probation; and if it were granted to the angels,
who shall say that it was not also given to the divine
mother while she lived on this earth, but especially in
the time of which I am speaking, when she remained
in the womb of her mother, and was certainly more
faithful than the angels, in corresponding with grace?
Mary, then, during all that time was redoubling continually
that sublime grace, which from the first moment
she possessed; for, corresponding with all her
power and perfection in every act she performed, at
every successive moment she redoubled her merits.
Hence, if, in the first moment, she had received a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_387"></a>[387]</span>
thousand degrees of grace, in the second she had two
thousand, in the third four thousand, in the fourth
eight thousand, in the fifth sixteen thousand, in the
sixth thirty thousand; and yet we have only reached
the sixth moment. But multiply in this way for a
whole day, multiply for nine months, and consider
what treasures of grace, of merits, and of sanctity
Mary brought into the world when she was born.</p>

<p>Let us rejoice, then, with our infant, who was born
so holy, so dear to God, and so full of grace; and let
us rejoice not only for her, but also for ourselves, since
she came into the world full of grace, not only for her
own glory, but for our good. St. Thomas says the
most holy Virgin was full of grace in three ways:
1st, She was full of grace in soul, so that from the
beginning her holy soul belonged entirely to God.
2d, She was full of grace in body, so that she merited
to clothe the eternal Word with her pure flesh. 3d,
She was full of grace for the common benefit, so that
all men might share it.<a id="FNanchor_1043" href="#Footnote_1043" class="fnanchor">[1043]</a> Some saints, adds the angelic
Doctor, have so much grace, that not only is it enough
for themselves, but also to save many others, not,
however, all men; only to Jesus Christ and Mary was
given so great a grace that it was sufficient to save all
men. If any one had enough for the salvation of all,
that would be the greatest; and this was in Jesus
Christ and the blessed Virgin.<a id="FNanchor_1044" href="#Footnote_1044" class="fnanchor">[1044]</a> Thus St. Thomas<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_388"></a>[388]</span>
writes. Hence, what St. John said of Jesus—“And
of his fulness we all have received”<a id="FNanchor_1045" href="#Footnote_1045" class="fnanchor">[1045]</a>—the saints say
of Mary. St. Thomas of Villanova says: Full of
grace, of whose fulness all receive.<a id="FNanchor_1046" href="#Footnote_1046" class="fnanchor">[1046]</a> Therefore St.
Anselm remarks, there is no one who does not share
in the grace of Mary.<a id="FNanchor_1047" href="#Footnote_1047" class="fnanchor">[1047]</a> And is there any one in the
world to whom Mary is not merciful, and on whom
she does not bestow some favor?<a id="FNanchor_1048" href="#Footnote_1048" class="fnanchor">[1048]</a> From Jesus, however
(we should understand), we receive grace as from
the author of grace, from Mary as the mediatrix; from
Jesus as the Saviour, from Mary as the advocate;
from Jesus as the fountain, from Mary as the channel.</p>

<p>Therefore St. Bernard says that God has established
Mary as the channel of the mercies which he wishes
to dispense to men; and for this reason he filled her
with grace, that every one might receive his portion
of her fulness. A full channel, that all might partake
of its fulness, but not receive the fulness itself.<a id="FNanchor_1049" href="#Footnote_1049" class="fnanchor">[1049]</a>
Hence the saint exhorts all to consider with how much
love God will have us honor this great Virgin, since
in her he has placed all the treasure of his blessings;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_389"></a>[389]</span>
that whatever we possess of hope, grace, and salvation,
we may thank our most loving queen for it; since
it all comes to us through her hands, and by her intercession.<a id="FNanchor_1050" href="#Footnote_1050" class="fnanchor">[1050]</a>
Miserable is that soul who closes for
herself this channel of grace, by neglecting to recommend
herself to Mary! When Holophernes wished
to make himself master of the city of Bethulia, he
ordered the aqueducts to be destroyed: “And he
commanded their aqueduct to be cut off.”<a id="FNanchor_1051" href="#Footnote_1051" class="fnanchor">[1051]</a> And this
the devil does when he wishes to make himself master
of a soul, he makes her abandon the devotion to the
most holy Mary. When this channel is closed, she
will at once lose the light and the fear of God, and
finally eternal salvation. By the following example
it will be seen how great is the compassion of the
heart of Mary, and the ruin which he brings upon
himself who closes this channel, and abandons devotion
to this queen of heaven.</p>

<h5>EXAMPLE.</h5>

<p>It is narrated by Tritemius, Canisius, and others,
that in Magdeburg, a city of Saxony, there was a
certain man named Udo, who, from his youth, had
been so destitute of talent that he was the ridicule of
all his school-fellows. Now one day, being more than<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_390"></a>[390]</span>
usually disheartened, he went to pray to the most holy
Virgin before her image. Mary appeared to him in a
dream, and said to him: “Udo, I will console you, and
not only will I obtain from God for you abilities which
will protect you from derision, but even talents which
will make you admired; and moreover, after the death
of the bishop, I promise that you shall be elected in
his place.” Thus Mary said, and thus it came to pass.
Udo made great progress in the sciences, and obtained
the bishopric of that city. But Udo was so
ungrateful to God and to his benefactress for these
favors, that he neglected all his devotions and became
the scandal of the place. Whilst he was in bed one
night with a wicked companion, he heard a voice saying
to him: “Udo, cease this sinful pastime, you have
sinned enough.”<a id="FNanchor_1052" href="#Footnote_1052" class="fnanchor">[1052]</a> At first he was irritated by these
words, thinking it was some one who was reproving
him; but hearing it repeated a second and a third
night, he began to tremble a little, lest it should be a
voice from heaven. Notwithstanding all this, he continued
in his wickedness. But after God had given
him three months for repentance, behold the punishment!
One night a devout canon, named Frederic,
was praying, in the church of St. Maurice, that God
would remove the scandal which Udo gave; when,
behold, the door of the church was burst open by a
strong wind. Two youths entered with lighted torches
in their hands, and stood on each side of the high<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_391"></a>[391]</span>
altar. Then two others followed, who spread before
the altar a carpet, and placed upon it two thrones of
gold. Another youth, in military attire, followed,
with a sword in his hand, and stopping in the midst
of the church, cried: “Oh ye saints of heaven, whose
relics are preserved in this church, come to assist at
the great justice which the sovereign Judge is about
to execute.” At these words many saints appeared,
and also the twelve apostles, as assistants in this
judgment. Lastly, Jesus Christ entered, and seated
himself on one of these thrones. Afterwards Mary
appeared, attended by many holy virgins, and seated
herself on the other throne at the side of her Son.
The Judge now ordered that the culprit should be
brought forward, and he was the miserable Udo. St.
Maurice spoke, and demanded, in the name of the people
whom he had scandalized, justice for his infamous
life. All present raised their voices and said: “Oh
Lord, he merits death.” “Let him die, then,” said
the eternal Judge. But before the sentence was executed
(see how great is the mercy of Mary) she, the
kind mother, that she might not be present at that
tremendous act of justice, left the church; and then
the heavenly minister, who entered among the first,
with the sword, approaching Udo, with one blow
severed the head from the body, and the vision vanished.
The place was left dark. The canon, trembling,
went for a light from a lamp which was burning
under the church; and when he returned, saw the
body of Udo with the head cut off, and the pavement<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_392"></a>[392]</span>
all covered with blood. When daylight came, the
people thronged the church, and the canon related the
whole vision and the circumstances of that fearful
tragedy. And on the same day the wretched Udo,
who was condemned to hell, appeared to one of his
chaplains, who knew nothing of what had taken place
in the church. The body of Udo was thrown into a
marsh, and his blood remained for a perpetual memorial
on that pavement, which was always covered
with a carpet; and from that time it became the custom
to uncover it when a new bishop took possession
of the church, that at the sight of such a punishment
he might be mindful to lead a good life, and not be
ungrateful for the graces of the Lord and of his most
holy mother.</p>

<h5>PRAYER.</h5>

<p>Oh holy and heavenly infant Mary! thou who art
the destined mother of my Redeemer and the great
mediatrix of miserable sinners, have pity on me. Behold
at thy feet another ungrateful creature who has
recourse to thee and implores thy mercy. It is true
that, for my ingratitude towards God and thee, I am
deserving of being abandoned by God and by thee;
but I have been told, and thus I believe, knowing how
great is thy compassion, that thou wilt not refuse to
help him who, with confidence, recommends himself
to thee. Thou, oh most exalted of all creatures, since
there is no one above thee but God, and, in comparison
with thee, the greatest in heaven are but small; oh<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_393"></a>[393]</span>
saint of saints, oh Mary, abyss of grace, full of grace,
help a miserable sinner who has lost it by his own
fault. I know that thou art so dear to God that he
denies thee nothing. I know also that thou dost rejoice
to employ thy greatness in relieving the distressed.
Ah, make known how great is thy favor with
God by obtaining for me a divine light and a flame so
powerful that it may change me from a sinner into a
saint, and, detaching me from every earthly affection,
may wholly inflame me with divine love. Do this, oh
Lady, because thou canst do it; do this for the love
of that God who has made thee so great, so powerful,
and merciful. Thus I hope. Amen.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h4 class="nobreak" id="DISCOURSE_III">DISCOURSE III.<br>
<span class="smaller">ON THE PRESENTATION OF MARY.</span></h4>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>The offering which Mary made of herself to God was prompt,
without delay; entire, without reserve.</i></p>

</div>

<p>There never has been, and there never will be, any
offering of a pure creature greater and more perfect
than that which Mary made to God, being yet only a
child of three years, when she presented herself in
the temple to offer him, not spices, nor calves, nor
talents of gold, but her whole self as a perfect holocaust,
consecrating herself as a perpetual victim in
his honor. Well did she understand the voice of God,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_394"></a>[394]</span>
which even then called her to dedicate herself wholly
to his love, with these words: Arise, make haste, my
love, and come: “Surge, propera, amica mea, et veni.”<a id="FNanchor_1053" href="#Footnote_1053" class="fnanchor">[1053]</a>
And therefore her Lord would have her from thenceforth
forget her country, her parents, and every thing,
to attend to nothing but to love and please him:
“Hearken, oh daughter, and see and incline thy ear;
and forget thy people and thy father’s house.”<a id="FNanchor_1054" href="#Footnote_1054" class="fnanchor">[1054]</a> And
she at once obeyed promptly the divine voice. Let
us consider, then, how acceptable to God was this
offering which Mary made of herself, as she presented
herself promptly and entirely to him; promptly without
delay; entirely without reserve; these are the two
points.</p>

<p><i>First Point.</i>—Mary offered herself to God promptly.
From the first moment when this heavenly infant was
sanctified in the womb of her mother (which was at
the first moment of her immaculate conception), she received
the perfect use of reason, that she might from
thenceforth begin to merit, as the Doctors universally
agree; and one of them, Father Suarez, says, that as
the most perfect mode by which God sanctifies a soul
is its sanctification by its own merits, as St. Thomas
teaches,<a id="FNanchor_1055" href="#Footnote_1055" class="fnanchor">[1055]</a> so it is to be believed that the blessed Virgin
has been thus sanctified.<a id="FNanchor_1056" href="#Footnote_1056" class="fnanchor">[1056]</a> And if this privilege<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_395"></a>[395]</span>
was granted to the angels and to Adam, as the angelic
Doctor says,<a id="FNanchor_1057" href="#Footnote_1057" class="fnanchor">[1057]</a> much more should we believe that it
was granted to the divine mother, on whom we cannot
doubt that God, having deigned to make her his mother,
conferred greater gifts than on all other creatures,
as the same Doctor teaches. From her he received
his human nature, hence before all others she must
have obtained from Christ the fulness of grace;<a id="FNanchor_1058" href="#Footnote_1058" class="fnanchor">[1058]</a> for,
being mother, as Father Suarez says, she has a certain
peculiar right to all the gifts of her Son.<a id="FNanchor_1059" href="#Footnote_1059" class="fnanchor">[1059]</a> And as,
by the hypostatic union, Jesus must of right have the
fulness of all graces; thus by the divine maternity, it
was meet that Jesus should confer on Mary, as a
natural debt, greater graces than those bestowed on
all the other saints and angels.</p>

<p>Thus, from the beginning of her life, Mary knew
God, and knew him so well, that no tongue, as the
angel declared to St. Bridget, shall suffice to tell how
the intellect of the holy Virgin clearly saw God in the
first moment she knew him.<a id="FNanchor_1060" href="#Footnote_1060" class="fnanchor">[1060]</a> And even in that first
moment of light by which she was illuminated, she
offered herself wholly to her Lord, dedicating herself<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_396"></a>[396]</span>
entirely to his lore and glory, as the angel continued
to say to St. Bridget: “At once our queen resolved to
sacrifice her will to God, with all her love, for the
whole time of her life; and no one can understand
how completely her will submitted itself then to embrace
all things pleasing to him.”<a id="FNanchor_1061" href="#Footnote_1061" class="fnanchor">[1061]</a></p>

<p>Yet, when the immaculate infant understood afterwards
that her holy parents, Joachim and Anna, had
promised to God, even by a vow, as various authors
relate, that if he should grant them a child, it should
be consecrated to his service in the temple; for it was
an ancient custom of the Jews to place their children
in cells which were near the temple, that there they
might be properly educated, as we learn from Baronius,
Nicephorus, Cedrenus, and Suarez, as also from
Josephus, the Jewish historian, St. John Damascene,
St. Gregory of Nicomedia, St. Anselm,<a id="FNanchor_1062" href="#Footnote_1062" class="fnanchor">[1062]</a> and St. Ambrose.<a id="FNanchor_1063" href="#Footnote_1063" class="fnanchor">[1063]</a>
As it is also clearly seen in Macchabees,
where, speaking of Heliodorus, who wished to enter
the temple by force, in order to take from it the treasures
deposited there, it is said: “Because the place
was like to come into contempt ... the virgins that
were shut up hastened to Onias.”<a id="FNanchor_1064" href="#Footnote_1064" class="fnanchor">[1064]</a> When Mary knew
of this vow, as I have before said, she wished solemnly
to offer and consecrate herself to God, by presenting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_397"></a>[397]</span>
herself in the temple, as Germanus asserts, and also
St. Epiphanius, who says, that when she was hardly
three years old she was presented in the temple,<a id="FNanchor_1065" href="#Footnote_1065" class="fnanchor">[1065]</a> at an
age when children have the greatest desire for the
assistance of their parents, and need it the most. She
was even the first to entreat her parents earnestly that
they would take her to the temple, to fulfil their promise;
and her holy mother, Anna, as St. Gregory of
Nyssa says, did not delay to bring her there, and offer
her to God.<a id="FNanchor_1066" href="#Footnote_1066" class="fnanchor">[1066]</a></p>

<p>And behold, Joachim and Anna, generously sacrificing
to God what was dearest to them on earth, set
out from Nazareth, carrying by turns, in their arms,
their beloved little daughter, who could not walk so
great a distance as was that from Nazareth to Jerusalem,
a journey, as several authors assert, of eighty
miles. They thus went on their way, accompanied by
only a few of their relations, but by hosts of angels, as
St. George of Nicomedia asserts,<a id="FNanchor_1067" href="#Footnote_1067" class="fnanchor">[1067]</a> who attended and
ministered to the immaculate Virgin, as she went to
dedicate herself to the Divine Majesty. How beautiful
are thy steps, oh prince’s daughter! “Quam pulchri
sunt gressus tui, filia principis!”<a id="FNanchor_1068" href="#Footnote_1068" class="fnanchor">[1068]</a> Oh, how beautiful,
how pleasing to God, as the angels sung, are
thy steps, as thou goest to offer thyself to him, oh<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_398"></a>[398]</span>
great and chosen daughter of our common Lord!
God himself on that day, says Bernardine de Bustis,
celebrated a great feast with the whole celestial court,
when he beheld his spouse conducted to the temple.<a id="FNanchor_1069" href="#Footnote_1069" class="fnanchor">[1069]</a>
For he never saw a creature more holy and more beloved
offering herself to him.<a id="FNanchor_1070" href="#Footnote_1070" class="fnanchor">[1070]</a> Go, then, said St.
Germanus, Archbishop of Constantinople, go, oh queen
of the world, oh mother of God, go joyfully to the
house of the Lord, to wait for the coming of the Holy
Spirit that will make thee mother of the eternal
Word.<a id="FNanchor_1071" href="#Footnote_1071" class="fnanchor">[1071]</a></p>

<p>When the holy company had arrived at the temple,
the eager child turned to her parents, kneeling kissed
their hands, and asked for their benediction; and then,
without turning back, she ascended the fifteen steps
of the temple, as Arias Montanus relates upon the authority
of Josephus, the Jewish historian, and presented
herself to the priest, who, according to St. Germanus,
was Zachary; then, taking leave of the world, and
renouncing all the goods which it promises to its followers,
she offered and consecrated herself to her Creator.</p>

<p>At the time of the deluge, the raven which was
sent by Noe from the ark remained to feed upon the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_399"></a>[399]</span>
bodies of the dead, but the dove without stopping to
rest her foot, returned quickly to the ark: She returned
to him into the ark: “Reversa est ad eum in
arcam.”<a id="FNanchor_1072" href="#Footnote_1072" class="fnanchor">[1072]</a> Many who are sent by God into this world,
unhappily stop to feed on earthly things. Not so
Mary, our celestial dove; she knew that God should
be our only good, our only hope, our only love; she
knew that the world is full of dangers, and that he
who the soonest leaves it, is freest from its snares;
therefore she sought promptly to flee from it in her tenderest
years, and seclude herself in the sacred retirement
of the temple, where she could better hear the
voice of God, and better honor and love him. And
thus the holy Virgin, from the beginning of her life,
rendered herself dear and acceptable to her Lord, as
the holy Church makes her say: “Rejoice with me,
all ye who love the Lord, for when I was little I
pleased the Most High.”<a id="FNanchor_1073" href="#Footnote_1073" class="fnanchor">[1073]</a> For this reason she was
compared to the moon; for as the moon completes
her course more quickly than the other planets, so
Mary attained perfection sooner than all the saints,
by giving herself promptly to God without delay;
and entirely without reserve. And now let us pass to
the second point, upon which we shall have much to
say.</p>

<p><i>Point Second.</i>—The enlightened infant well knew<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_400"></a>[400]</span>
that God does not accept a divided heart, but wishes
it entirely consecrated to his love, according to the
precept he has given: “Thou shalt love the Lord
thy God with thy whole heart.”<a id="FNanchor_1074" href="#Footnote_1074" class="fnanchor">[1074]</a> Hence, from the
first moment of her existence, she began to love God
with all her strength, and gave herself wholly to him.
But her most holy soul awaited with earnest desire the
time when she could in reality consecrate herself entirely,
and with a public solemnity, to God. Let us
consider, then, with how great a fervor the loving Virgin,
seeing herself actually inclosed in that holy place,
first prostrated herself to kiss that ground as the house
of the Lord, then adored his infinite majesty, and
thanked him for the favor she had received of being
brought so early to inhabit his house. Then she offered
herself entirely to her God; entirely, without
reserving any thing. She offered to him all her powers
and all her senses, her whole mind and her whole
heart, her whole soul and her whole body, for it was
then, as we are told, that to please God, she made the
vow of virginity. A vow, according to Rupert the
Abbot, that Mary was the first to make: “Votum virginitatis
prima emisit.”<a id="FNanchor_1075" href="#Footnote_1075" class="fnanchor">[1075]</a> And she offered herself without
limitation of time, as Bernardine de Bustis asserts:
Mary offered and dedicated herself to the perpetual
service of God.<a id="FNanchor_1076" href="#Footnote_1076" class="fnanchor">[1076]</a> Since she had then the intention<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_401"></a>[401]</span>
of dedicating her whole life to the service of his Divine
Majesty in the temple, if it should so please God; and
of never quitting that sacred place, Oh, with what affection
must she have exclaimed: My beloved to me,
and I to him: “Dilectus meus mihi, et ego illi.”<a id="FNanchor_1077" href="#Footnote_1077" class="fnanchor">[1077]</a> I
for him, as Cardinal Hugo remarks, will wholly live
and will wholly die: “Ego illi tota vivam, et tota moriar.”
My Lord and my God, she said, I have come
hither only to please thee, and to give thee all the
honor I can; here I will live wholly for thee and die
for thee, if it so please thee; accept the sacrifice which
this thy poor servant makes to thee, and help me to be
faithful to thee.</p>

<p>And here let us consider how holy was the life that
Mary led in the temple, where, like the rising morn,
“Quasi aurora consurgens,” increasing always in perfection,
as the dawn increases in light; who can describe
how, from day to day, in her more brightly
shone her virtues; charity, modesty, humility, silence,
mortification, meekness? This fair olive-tree, planted
in the house of God, as St. John Damascene says,
under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, became the
habitation of all the virtues.<a id="FNanchor_1078" href="#Footnote_1078" class="fnanchor">[1078]</a> The same saint says in
another place: The countenance of the Virgin was
modest, her mind humble, her words kind, proceeding
from a recollected heart.<a id="FNanchor_1079" href="#Footnote_1079" class="fnanchor">[1079]</a> And he elsewhere asserts:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_402"></a>[402]</span>
The Virgin withdrew her thoughts from all earthly
things, embracing all the virtues. Thus, then, by the
practice of perfection, she made so great progress in a
short time, as to merit being made a temple worthy of
God.<a id="FNanchor_1080" href="#Footnote_1080" class="fnanchor">[1080]</a></p>

<p>St. Anselm, also, speaking of the life of the holy
Virgin in the temple, says: Mary was docile, spoke
little, was always composed, never laughed, was never
distracted. She persevered in prayer, in the reading
of the Holy Scripture, in fasting, and all virtuous
works.<a id="FNanchor_1081" href="#Footnote_1081" class="fnanchor">[1081]</a> St. Jerome goes more into detail, and tells
us how Mary’s life was ordered: From early in the
morning till nine o’clock she remained in prayer; from
nine to three she was engaged in labor; at three
she resumed her prayers, until the angel, as usual,
brought her food. She was the most constant in
vigils, the most exact in obedience to the divine law,
the most profound in humility, and the most perfect
in every virtue. No one ever saw her angry; all her
words were so full of sweetness, that when she spoke
it always appeared that God was with her.<a id="FNanchor_1082" href="#Footnote_1082" class="fnanchor">[1082]</a></p>

<p>The divine mother herself revealed to St. Elizabeth,
a Benedictine nun, in the convent of Sconaugia, as we
read in St. Bonaventure,<a id="FNanchor_1083" href="#Footnote_1083" class="fnanchor">[1083]</a> that when she was left in
the temple by her parents, she resolved on having<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_403"></a>[403]</span>
God alone for father, and often thought what she
could do to please him.<a id="FNanchor_1084" href="#Footnote_1084" class="fnanchor">[1084]</a> She determined, moreover,
to consecrate to him her virginity, and to possess
nothing in the world, giving her entire will to God.<a id="FNanchor_1085" href="#Footnote_1085" class="fnanchor">[1085]</a>
She also told her that above all the divine precepts to
be observed, she placed before her eyes the precept,
“Thou shalt love the Lord thy God,”<a id="FNanchor_1086" href="#Footnote_1086" class="fnanchor">[1086]</a> and that she
went in the middle of the night to pray the Lord before
the altar of the temple, that he would grant her
the grace to observe the commandments, and to see the
mother of the Redeemer born while she lived, praying
him that he would preserve her eyes to see her, her
tongue to praise her, her hands and feet to serve her,
and her knees to adore in her arms, his divine Son.
St. Elizabeth, on hearing this, said to her: “But, my
Lady, were you not full of grace and virtue?” and
Mary answered her: “Know that I esteemed myself
the most vile, and unworthy of divine grace; therefore
I prayed thus for grace and virtues.” And, finally,
that she might persuade us of the absolute necessity
we are all under, of asking from God the graces that
we need, she added: “Do you think that I obtained
grace and virtue without effort? Know that I received
no grace from God without great effort, constant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_404"></a>[404]</span>
prayer, ardent desire, and many tears and penances.”</p>

<p>But above all, we should consider the revelations
made to St. Bridget, of the virtues and exercises
practised by the blessed Virgin in her childhood, in
these words: “Even from an infant Mary was filled
with the Holy Spirit, and as she increased in age, she
increased also in grace. Even from that time she resolved
to love God with all her heart, so that he
should never be offended by her actions or her words,
and for this reason all the goods of earth were despised
by her. She gave all she could to the poor.
In her food she was so temperate that she only took
what was absolutely necessary to support life. Discovering
then from the sacred Scriptures, that this
God was to be born from a virgin to redeem the
world, her spirit was so kindled with divine love that
she desired and thought only of God; and taking
pleasure only in God, shunned the conversation even
of her parents, that they might not hinder her from
thinking on God. And more than all did she desire
that the coming of the Messiah might be in her
day, that she might be the servant to that happy
Virgin who merited to be his mother.” Thus the revelations
made to St. Bridget.<a id="FNanchor_1087" href="#Footnote_1087" class="fnanchor">[1087]</a></p>

<p>Ah, for love of this exalted child the Redeemer
hastened his coming into the world, for whilst she
through her humility did not esteem herself worthy of
being the servant of the divine mother, she was herself<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_405"></a>[405]</span>
chosen for this mother, and by the odor of her
virtues and her powerful prayers, she drew into her
virginal womb the divine Son. Hence was Mary
called the turtle by her divine spouse: The voice of
the turtle is heard in our land: “Vox turturis audita
est in terra nostra.”<a id="FNanchor_1088" href="#Footnote_1088" class="fnanchor">[1088]</a> Not only because she, like the
turtle, always loved solitude, living in this world as in
a desert, but also because, like the turtle who makes
the fields mournful with its sad note, Mary was always
mourning in the temple over the miseries of the
lost world, and asking from God, the Redeemer of the
world. Oh, with how much greater affection and
fervor than the prophets did she repeat to God in the
temple their supplications and sighs, that he might
send the Redeemer! “Send forth, oh Lord, the Lamb,
the ruler of the earth.”<a id="FNanchor_1089" href="#Footnote_1089" class="fnanchor">[1089]</a> “Drop down dew, ye heavens,
from above, and let the clouds rain the just.”<a id="FNanchor_1090" href="#Footnote_1090" class="fnanchor">[1090]</a> “Oh,
that thou wouldst rend the heavens and wouldst come
down.”<a id="FNanchor_1091" href="#Footnote_1091" class="fnanchor">[1091]</a></p>

<p>In a word, it was an object of delight to God to
see this young Virgin always ascending to a higher
perfection, like a pillar of smoke, rich in the odors of all
virtues, as the Holy Spirit exactly describes her in the
sacred Canticles: “Who is she that goeth up by the
desert, as a pillar of smoke of aromatical spices, of
myrrh, and frankincense, and of all the powders of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_406"></a>[406]</span>
the perfumer?”<a id="FNanchor_1092" href="#Footnote_1092" class="fnanchor">[1092]</a> This holy child, says Sophronius,
was in truth the garden of delights of the Lord, for
he found there flowers of every kind, and all the odors
of the virtues.<a id="FNanchor_1093" href="#Footnote_1093" class="fnanchor">[1093]</a> This St. John Chrysostom affirms,
that God chose Mary for his mother on earth, because
he found not on the earth a more perfect and more
holy Virgin than Mary, neither a place more worthy
for him to dwell in than her sacred womb;<a id="FNanchor_1094" href="#Footnote_1094" class="fnanchor">[1094]</a> as St.
Bernard also says: On the earth there was no more
worthy place than the womb of the Virgin.<a id="FNanchor_1095" href="#Footnote_1095" class="fnanchor">[1095]</a> St. Antoninus
asserts that the blessed Virgin, in order to be
elected and predestined to the dignity of mother of
God, must have possessed a perfection so great and
consummate, that it should surpass the perfection of
all other creatures.<a id="FNanchor_1096" href="#Footnote_1096" class="fnanchor">[1096]</a></p>

<p>As then the holy young child Mary, presented
and offered herself in the temple promptly and entirely,
so let us, at this day, without delay and without
reserve, present ourselves to Mary, and entreat her to
offer us to God, who will not refuse us when he sees
us offered by the hand of her who was the living
temple of the Holy Spirit, the delight of her Lord,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_407"></a>[407]</span>
and the chosen mother of the Eternal Word. And
let us place a great hope in this exalted and most
gracious Lady, who rewards with so much love the
devotions that are offered to her by her servants, as
may be seen by the following example.</p>

<h5>EXAMPLE.</h5>

<p>We read in the life of Sister Domenica of Paradise,
written by Father Ignatius of Niente, a Dominican,
that in a village called Paradise, near Florence, this
little girl was born of poor parents. From her infancy
she practised devotion to the divine mother.
She fasted every day of the week in her honor, and
on Saturday she distributed to the poor the food of
which she had deprived herself; and every Saturday
she went into the garden, or into the neighboring
fields, and there gathered all the flowers she could
find, and placed them before a statue of the holy
Virgin with the infant Jesus in her arms, which she
had in her house. But let us see now with what
favors our most grateful Lady compensated this her
servant, for the homage she paid her. As she stood
one Sunday at the window, when she was about ten
years of age, she saw in the street a woman with a
beautiful countenance, accompanied by a little child,
and they both extended their hands as if to ask alms.
She went for some bread, and, behold, before she
could open the door, they stood beside her, and she
saw wounds on the hands, feet, and breast of the
child. Then she said to the woman: “Who has<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_408"></a>[408]</span>
wounded this child?” “It was love,” answered the
mother. Domenica, charmed by his beauty and modesty,
asked him if his wounds pained him; but he
only answered with a smile. As they were standing
near the images of Jesus and of Mary, the mother
said to Domenica: “Tell me, little girl, what makes
you crown these images with flowers?” She answered:
“The love I have for Jesus and Mary makes me do
it.” “And how much do you love them?” “I love
them as much as I can.” “And how much can you
love them?” “As much as they will help me.”
“Continue, then,” said the mother, “continue to love
them, for they will richly return your love in paradise.”</p>

<p>Then the little girl perceived a celestial odor coming
forth from those wounds, and she asked the mother
with what ointment she had anointed them, and if that
ointment could be purchased? “It is purchased,”
answered she, “with faith and works.” Domenica
then offered them the bread. The mother said: “The
food of this my Son is love; tell him that you love
Jesus and he will be satisfied.” The child at mention
of this word love, began to show great signs of joy,
and turning to the little girl, he asked her how much
she loved Jesus. She answered that she loved him so
much, that day and night she was always thinking of
him, and desired nothing else but to please him as
much as she could. “Well,” answered he, “love him;
and love will teach you what you must do to satisfy
him.” The odor then increasing which came from
those wounds, Domenica exclaimed: “Oh God, this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_409"></a>[409]</span>
odor makes me die of love; if the odor of a child is
so sweet, what must be the odors of paradise?” But
behold the scene was changed; the mother appeared
robed as a queen, and surrounded with light, and the
child resplendent as a sun of beauty. He took those
flowers and strewed them on her head. She at once
saw that these persons were Jesus and Mary, and
prostrated herself in adoration before them. And
thus ended the vision. Domenica afterwards took the
Dominican habit, and died in the year 1553, with the
reputation of a saint.</p>

<h5>PRAYER.</h5>

<p>Oh beloved of God! most amiable child Mary! oh,
that like thee, who didst present thyself in the temple,
and at once and wholly didst consecrate thyself to
the glory and love of thy God, I might offer to thee
to-day the first years of my life, and dedicate myself
entirely to thy service, oh my most holy and sweet
Lady! But it is now too late, for, unhappily, I have
lost so many years in serving the world and my caprices,
as it were entirely forgetful of thee and of God.
Alas for the time in which I did not love thee!<a id="FNanchor_1097" href="#Footnote_1097" class="fnanchor">[1097]</a> But
it is better to commence late than not at all. Behold,
oh Mary, to-day I present myself to thee, and offer
myself entirely to thy service, for the longer or shorter
time that remains for me to live on the earth; and
with thee I renounce all creatures, and dedicate myself<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_410"></a>[410]</span>
entirely to the love of my Creator. I consecrate
to thee, then, oh queen, my mind, that I may always
think of the love that thou dost merit, my tongue to
praise thee, and my heart to love thee. Accept, oh
most holy Virgin, the offering which the most miserable
sinner presents to thee; accept it, I pray thee,
for the sake of that consolation which filled thy heart
when in the temple thou gavest thyself to God. And
if late I begin to serve thee, it is right that I should
make good the time lost by redoubling my devotion
and my love. Aid my weakness, oh mother of mercy,
with thy powerful intercession, and obtain for me
perseverance and strength to be faithful to thee until
death; that always serving thee in this life, I may
come to praise thee eternally in paradise.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h4 class="nobreak" id="DISCOURSE_IV">DISCOURSE IV.<br>
<span class="smaller">ON THE ANNUNCIATION OF MARY.</span></h4>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>Mary could not humble herself more than she did in the
incarnation of the Word. On the other hand, God could
not exalt her more than he has exalted her.</i></p>

</div>

<p>“Whosoever shall exalt himself shall be humbled,
and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted.”<a id="FNanchor_1098" href="#Footnote_1098" class="fnanchor">[1098]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_411"></a>[411]</span>
These are the words of our Lord, and cannot fail.
Therefore, God having determined to make himself
man, in order to redeem lost man, and thus manifest
to the world his infinite goodness, being about to choose
on earth his mother, sought among women the holiest
and most humble. Among them all he saw one, the
youthful virgin Mary, who, as she was the most perfect
in all virtues, so was she the most simple; and
humble as a dove in her own esteem. “There are
young maidens without number; one is my dove, my
perfect one.”<a id="FNanchor_1099" href="#Footnote_1099" class="fnanchor">[1099]</a> Let this one, then, said God, be my
chosen mother. Let us, then, see how humble Mary
was, and how God exalted her. Mary could not humble
herself more than she did in the incarnation of the
Word; this will be the first point. That God could
not exalt Mary more than he exalted her, will be the
second.</p>

<p><i>First Point.</i>—Our Lord in the holy Canticles, speaking
precisely of the humility of this most humble
Virgin, said: “While the king was at his repose, my
spikenard sent forth the odor thereof.”<a id="FNanchor_1100" href="#Footnote_1100" class="fnanchor">[1100]</a> St. Antoninus,
commenting on these words, says that the spikenard,
inasmuch as it is a small and lowly plant, was
a type of the humility of Mary, whose odor ascended
to heaven, and drew, even from the bosom of the eternal
Father, into her virginal womb the divine Word.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_412"></a>[412]</span>
The spikenard is a small herb, and signifies the blessed
Virgin, who exhaled the odor of humility; which odor
ascended even to heaven, and in heaven as it were
awakened him who was in his repose, and brought
him to rest in her womb.<a id="FNanchor_1101" href="#Footnote_1101" class="fnanchor">[1101]</a> Thus the Lord, drawn
by the odor of this humble Virgin, chose her for his
mother, when he wished to become man to redeem
the world. But he, for the greater glory and merit
of this his mother, would not make himself her Son
without first obtaining her consent. He would not
take flesh from her without her consent.<a id="FNanchor_1102" href="#Footnote_1102" class="fnanchor">[1102]</a> Therefore,
when the humble young Virgin was in her poor dwelling,
sighing and praying to God more earnestly than
ever that he would send the Redeemer, as was revealed
to St. Elizabeth, a Benedictine nun, behold the
Archangel Gabriel came, bearing the great embassy.
He enters and salutes her, saying: “Hail, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee; blessed art thou among women.”<a id="FNanchor_1103" href="#Footnote_1103" class="fnanchor">[1103]</a>
Hail, oh Virgin, full of grace, for thou wast always
rich in grace above all the other saints. The Lord is
with thee because thou art so humble. Thou art
blessed among women, for all others have incurred the
curse of original sin; but thou, because thou art to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_413"></a>[413]</span>
be the mother of the Blessed One, hast been and wilt
always be blessed, and free from every stain.</p>

<p>But what does the humble Mary answer to this
salutation so full of praises? She answered nothing,
but she was disturbed thinking on such a salutation:
“And when she had heard, she was troubled at his
saying, and thought with herself what manner of
salutation this should be.”<a id="FNanchor_1104" href="#Footnote_1104" class="fnanchor">[1104]</a> And why was she disturbed?
through fear of illusion, or through modesty
at the sight of a man, as some suppose, remembering
that the angel appeared to her in human form? No,
the text is plain; she was troubled at his saying,
“turbata est in sermone ejus,” as Eusebius Emissenus
remarks: Not by his appearance, but by his speech:
“Non in vultu, sed in sermone ejus.” Such a disturbance
was then wholly owing to her humility at
hearing those praises, so far beyond her humble esteem
of herself. Hence the more she is exalted by
the angel, the more she humbles herself, and the
more she considers her nothingness. St. Bernardine
remarks: If the angel had said that she was the
greatest sinner in the world, Mary would not have
been thus surprised; but in hearing those exalted
praises she was greatly disturbed.<a id="FNanchor_1105" href="#Footnote_1105" class="fnanchor">[1105]</a> She was troubled
because, being so full of humility, she abhorred every<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_414"></a>[414]</span>
praise, and desired that none but her Creator, the
giver of every good, should be praised and blessed.
Mary said exactly this to St. Bridget, speaking of the
time when she became mother of God. “I disliked
my own praise, and only wished to hear that of the
giver and Creator.”<a id="FNanchor_1106" href="#Footnote_1106" class="fnanchor">[1106]</a></p>

<p>But I would remark, that the blessed Virgin had
already well learned from the Holy Scriptures that
the time foretold by the prophets for the coming of
the Messiah had arrived; that the weeks of Daniel
were now completed; that already, according to the
prophecy of Jacob, the sceptre of Judah had passed
into the hands of Herod, a strange king, and she well
knew that a virgin was to be the mother of the Messiah;
and she hears those praises offered by the angel to
herself, which seemed to belong only to the mother of
God; did it then come into her mind that perhaps
she herself might be that chosen mother of God?
No, her profound humility did not permit this thought.
These praises had no other effect than to cause her
great fear; so that, as St. Peter Chrysologus remarks:
As Christ wished to be consoled by an angel,
so must the Virgin be encouraged by an angel.<a id="FNanchor_1107" href="#Footnote_1107" class="fnanchor">[1107]</a> As
the Saviour willed to be comforted by an angel, so it
was necessary that St. Gabriel, seeing Mary so full of
fear at that salutation, should encourage her, saying:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_415"></a>[415]</span>
“Fear not, Mary, for thou hast found grace with
God.”<a id="FNanchor_1108" href="#Footnote_1108" class="fnanchor">[1108]</a> Do not fear, oh Mary, nor be surprised by
the great titles by which I have saluted thee, for if
thou art so little and humble in thine own eyes, God,
who exalts the humble, has made thee worthy to find
the grace lost by man; and therefore has he preserved
thee from the common stain of all the children
of Adam; therefore, even from the moment of thy
conception he has adorned thee with a greater grace
than that of all the saints; and therefore, finally, he
now exalts thee to be his mother: “Behold, thou shalt
conceive and shalt bring forth a son, and thou shalt
call his name Jesus.”<a id="FNanchor_1109" href="#Footnote_1109" class="fnanchor">[1109]</a></p>

<p>Now why this delay? The angel, oh Lady, awaits
thy answer, as St. Bernard says: We rather await it
who are condemned to death.<a id="FNanchor_1110" href="#Footnote_1110" class="fnanchor">[1110]</a> Behold, oh our
mother, continues St. Bernard, to thee is now offered
the price of our salvation, which will be the divine
Word in thee made man; if thou wilt accept him for
a son, we shall be immediately delivered from death;
behold the price of our salvation is offered to thee;
immediately we are liberated if thou dost consent.<a id="FNanchor_1111" href="#Footnote_1111" class="fnanchor">[1111]</a>
Thy Lord himself, as he is greatly enamored of thy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_416"></a>[416]</span>
beauty, so much the more desires thy consent, on
which he has made the salvation of the world depend.<a id="FNanchor_1112" href="#Footnote_1112" class="fnanchor">[1112]</a>
Answer quickly, oh Lady, adds St. Augustine,
delay no longer the salvation of the world, which
now depends on thy consent.<a id="FNanchor_1113" href="#Footnote_1113" class="fnanchor">[1113]</a></p>

<p>But, behold, Mary already answers; she answers
the angel, and says: “Behold the handmaid of the
Lord, be it done unto me according to thy word.”<a id="FNanchor_1114" href="#Footnote_1114" class="fnanchor">[1114]</a>
Oh, what more beautiful, more humble, and more prudent
answer could all the wisdom of men and of
angels united have invented, if they had thought of
it for millions of years! Oh powerful answer, which
gave joy in heaven, and poured upon the earth a vast
flood of graces and blessings! Answer, that hardly
came forth from the humble heart of Mary before it
drew from the bosom of the eternal Father, the only
begotten Son, to become man in her most pure womb!
yes, for hardly had she uttered these words: Behold the
handmaid of the Lord; be it done to me according to
thy word; when immediately the Word was made flesh:
“Verbum caro factum est;” the Son of God became
also the Son of Mary. Oh powerful Fiat! exclaims St.
Thomas of Villanova; oh efficacious Fiat! oh Fiat to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_417"></a>[417]</span>
be reverenced above every fiat!<a id="FNanchor_1115" href="#Footnote_1115" class="fnanchor">[1115]</a> for by another fiat
God created the light, the heaven, and the earth; but
by this fiat of Mary, says the saint, God became man
like us.</p>

<p>But let us not wander from our point, let us consider
the great humility of the Virgin in this answer.
She was indeed well enlightened to understand how
great was the dignity of the mother of God. She
already had been assured by the angel that she was
this happy mother chosen by the Lord. But with all
this she is not at all raised in her own esteem, stops
not at all to enjoy her exaltation, but considering on
one side her own nothingness, and on the other the
infinite majesty of her God, who chose her for his
mother, she knows how unworthy she is of such an
honor, but would by no means oppose herself to his
will. Hence, when her consent was asked, what does
she do? what does she say? Wholly annihilated as
to self; all inflamed, on the other hand, with the desire
of uniting herself thus more closely to God, by
entirely abandoning herself to the divine will: Behold,
she answers, behold the handmaid of the Lord: “Ecce
ancilla Domini.” Behold the slave of the Lord;
obliged to do whatever her Lord commands. And
she intended to say: If the Lord chooses me for his
mother, who have nothing of my own; if all that I
have is his gift, who could think that he selects me
for any merit of my own? Behold the handmaid of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_418"></a>[418]</span>
the Lord. What merit can a slave have, to be made
the mother of her Lord? Behold the handmaid of the
Lord. Let the goodness of God alone be praised,
and not the slave; since it is wholly his goodness
which has led him to place his eye on a creature so
lowly as I, and make her so great.</p>

<p>Oh humility, exclaims here Guerric the Abbot;
small in its own eyes, great in the eyes of God! Insufficient
to itself, sufficient to him whom the whole
world cannot contain!<a id="FNanchor_1116" href="#Footnote_1116" class="fnanchor">[1116]</a> But still more beautiful on
this occasion is the exclamation of St. Bernard, which
he makes in the fourth sermon on the Assumption of
Mary, in which, admiring the humility of Mary, he
says: Oh Lady, how have you been able to unite in
your heart such an humble esteem of yourself with so
much purity, so much innocence, and with such fulness
of grace<a id="FNanchor_1117" href="#Footnote_1117" class="fnanchor">[1117]</a> as thou dost possess! And whence, oh
blessed Virgin, did this humility, this so great humility,
take such deep root in thee, when thou wast so
honored and exalted by God?<a id="FNanchor_1118" href="#Footnote_1118" class="fnanchor">[1118]</a> Lucifer, seeing himself
endowed with great beauty, aspired to exalt his
throne above the stars, and make himself like to God.<a id="FNanchor_1119" href="#Footnote_1119" class="fnanchor">[1119]</a>
Now what would not that proud spirit have said and
attempted if he had seen himself adorned with the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_419"></a>[419]</span>
privileges of Mary? Not so the humble Mary; the
more she saw herself exalted, the more she humbled
herself. Ah Lady, for this beautiful humility, concludes
St. Bernard, thou hast indeed merited to be
regarded by God with peculiar love, to charm thy
King with thy beauty; to draw him with the sweet
odor of thy humility from his repose in the bosom of
God, into thy most pure womb.<a id="FNanchor_1120" href="#Footnote_1120" class="fnanchor">[1120]</a> Hence St. Bernardine
de Bustis says, that Mary merited more by
that answer: “Behold the handmaid of the Lord,”
than all creatures could merit by their works.<a id="FNanchor_1121" href="#Footnote_1121" class="fnanchor">[1121]</a></p>

<p>Thus, says St. Bernard, this innocent Virgin, although
by her virginity she rendered herself dear to
God, yet by humility afterwards rendered herself
worthy, as much as a creature can render itself worthy,
to be made the mother of her Creator. Although
she pleased by her virginity, by her humility she conceived:
“Etsi placuit ex virginitate, tamen ex humilitate
concepit.”<a id="FNanchor_1122" href="#Footnote_1122" class="fnanchor">[1122]</a> And St. Jerome confirms this by
saying, that God chose her for his mother more for
her humility, than for all her other sublime virtues.<a id="FNanchor_1123" href="#Footnote_1123" class="fnanchor">[1123]</a>
Mary herself expressed this to St. Bridget, by saying<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_420"></a>[420]</span>
to her: How did I merit such a grace to be made the
mother of my Lord, if not because I knew my nothingness,
and humiliated myself?<a id="FNanchor_1124" href="#Footnote_1124" class="fnanchor">[1124]</a> And this she declared
before in her Canticle, so full of the deepest
humility, when she said: “Because he hath regarded
the humility of his handmaid.... He that is mighty
hath done great things to me.”<a id="FNanchor_1125" href="#Footnote_1125" class="fnanchor">[1125]</a> Upon which words
St. Lawrence Justinian remarks, that the blessed Virgin
does not say, he regarded my virginity, my innocence,
but only my humility.<a id="FNanchor_1126" href="#Footnote_1126" class="fnanchor">[1126]</a> And by this humility,
as St. Francis de Sales remarks, Mary did not intend
to praise the virtue of her humility, but wished to
proclaim that God had regarded her nothingness, <i>humility,
that is, nothingness</i>: “Humilitatem, id est nihilitatem,”
and through his pure goodness had willed
thus to exalt her.</p>

<p>In a word, St. Augustine says that the humility of
Mary was like a ladder, by which our Lord deigned
to descend upon earth to become man in her womb.<a id="FNanchor_1127" href="#Footnote_1127" class="fnanchor">[1127]</a>
And St. Antoninus confirms this by saying that the
humility of the Virgin was her most perfect and the
next preparation to become the mother of God.<a id="FNanchor_1128" href="#Footnote_1128" class="fnanchor">[1128]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_421"></a>[421]</span>
And by this is explained what Isaias predicted: “And
there shall come forth a rod out of the root of Jesse,
and a flower shall rise up out of his root.”<a id="FNanchor_1129" href="#Footnote_1129" class="fnanchor">[1129]</a> The
blessed Albertus Magnus remarks, that the divine
flower, namely, the only-begotten of God, according
to Isaias, would come forth, not from the top or the
trunk of the tree of Jesse, but from its root, which
precisely denotes the humility of the mother.<a id="FNanchor_1130" href="#Footnote_1130" class="fnanchor">[1130]</a> And
this is more clearly explained by the Abbot of Celles.
Observe, says he, that not from the top, but from the
root the flower is to spring up.<a id="FNanchor_1131" href="#Footnote_1131" class="fnanchor">[1131]</a> And therefore our
Lord said to this his beloved daughter: “Turn away
thy eyes from me, for they have made me flee away.”<a id="FNanchor_1132" href="#Footnote_1132" class="fnanchor">[1132]</a>
And from whence flee, unless from the bosom of the
Father to the womb of Mary?<a id="FNanchor_1133" href="#Footnote_1133" class="fnanchor">[1133]</a> as St. Augustine
says. Upon which the learned interpreter Fernandez
observes, that the most humble eyes of Mary, with
which she always contemplated the divine greatness,
never losing sight of her nothingness, did such violence
to God himself that they drew him into her bosom.<a id="FNanchor_1134" href="#Footnote_1134" class="fnanchor">[1134]</a>
And by this we are to understand, says Francone the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_422"></a>[422]</span>
Abbot, why the Holy Spirit so much praised the
beauty of this his spouse for her eyes, which were
like those of a dove: “How beautiful art thou, my
love! how beautiful art thou! thy eyes are like doves’
eyes;”<a id="FNanchor_1135" href="#Footnote_1135" class="fnanchor">[1135]</a> because Mary, looking on God with the eyes
of a simple, humble dove, he was so much enamored
of her beauty, that with the bands of love she made
him a prisoner in her virginal womb; these are the
words of the abbot: In what place on the earth could
so beautiful a virgin be found, who could allure the
King of heaven by her eyes, and by a holy violence
lead him captive, bound in the chains of charity?<a id="FNanchor_1136" href="#Footnote_1136" class="fnanchor">[1136]</a>
We will conclude this point by remarking that Mary,
in the incarnation of the Word, as we have seen from
the beginning, could not have humiliated herself more
than she did. Let us now see how God could exalt
her no higher than he did by making her his mother.</p>

<p><i>Point Second.</i>—In order to comprehend the greatness
to which Mary was elevated, it would be necessary
to comprehend the sublime majesty and grandeur
of God. It is sufficient, then, only to say, that
God made this Virgin his mother, to have it understood
that God could not exalt her more than he did
exalt her. Rightly did St. Arnold Carnotensis affirm,
that God, by making himself the Son of the Virgin,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_423"></a>[423]</span>
established her in a superior rank to all the saints and
angels: “Maria constituta est super omnem Creaturam.”<a id="FNanchor_1137" href="#Footnote_1137" class="fnanchor">[1137]</a>
So that, next to God, she is incomparably
higher than the celestial spirits, as St. Ephrem asserts:
“Nulla comparatione cæteris superis est gloriosior.”<a id="FNanchor_1138" href="#Footnote_1138" class="fnanchor">[1138]</a>
St. Andrew of Crete confirms this, saying: God excepted,
she is the highest of all: “Excepto Deo, omnibus
est altior.”<a id="FNanchor_1139" href="#Footnote_1139" class="fnanchor">[1139]</a> And St. Anselm also says: Oh Lady, there
is none equal to thee, because every other is above or
beneath thee; God alone is superior to thee, and all
others are inferior.<a id="FNanchor_1140" href="#Footnote_1140" class="fnanchor">[1140]</a> So great, in a word, says St.
Bernardine, is the exaltation of this Virgin, that God
alone is able to comprehend it.<a id="FNanchor_1141" href="#Footnote_1141" class="fnanchor">[1141]</a></p>

<p>This removes the surprise expressed by some persons,
remarks St. Thomas of Villanova, that the holy
Evangelists, who have so fully recorded the praises of
a Baptist and a Magdalene, have been so brief in their
descriptions of the privileges of Mary; for, says the
saint, it was enough to say of her, that from her Jesus
was born.<a id="FNanchor_1142" href="#Footnote_1142" class="fnanchor">[1142]</a> What more would you wish the Evangelists
to say, continues the saint, of the grandeur of this
Virgin? let it be enough for you, that they attest her
to be the mother of God. Having recorded in these<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_424"></a>[424]</span>
few words the greatest, and, indeed, the whole of her
merits, it was not necessary for them to describe each
separately.<a id="FNanchor_1143" href="#Footnote_1143" class="fnanchor">[1143]</a> And why not? because, as St. Anselm
answers: To say of Mary this alone, that she was the
mother of a God, transcends every glory that can be
attributed to her, in thought or word, after God.<a id="FNanchor_1144" href="#Footnote_1144" class="fnanchor">[1144]</a>
Peter of Celles adds, remarking on this same thought:
By whatever name you may wish to call her, whether
queen of heaven, ruler of the angels, or any other title
of honor, you will never succeed in honoring her so
much as by calling her only the mother of God.<a id="FNanchor_1145" href="#Footnote_1145" class="fnanchor">[1145]</a></p>

<p>The reason of this is evident, for as the angelic Doctor
teaches: The nearer a thing approaches its author, the
greater the perfection it receives from him; therefore,
Mary being the creature nearest to God, she has partaken
more than all others of his grace, perfection, and
greatness.<a id="FNanchor_1146" href="#Footnote_1146" class="fnanchor">[1146]</a> To this Father Suarez traces the cause<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_425"></a>[425]</span>
why the dignity of mother of God is of an order
superior to any other created dignity; because
it appertains, in a certain manner, to the order of
union with a divine person, with which union it is necessarily
connected.<a id="FNanchor_1147" href="#Footnote_1147" class="fnanchor">[1147]</a> Hence St. Denis the Carthusian
asserts, that after the hypostatic union, there is
none more intimate than the union of the mother of
God with her Son.<a id="FNanchor_1148" href="#Footnote_1148" class="fnanchor">[1148]</a> This, as St. Thomas teaches, is
the highest union that a pure creature can have with
God.<a id="FNanchor_1149" href="#Footnote_1149" class="fnanchor">[1149]</a> And the blessed Albertus Magnus affirms,
that to be mother of God is a dignity next to that of
being God;<a id="FNanchor_1150" href="#Footnote_1150" class="fnanchor">[1150]</a> therefore he says, that Mary could not
be more united to God than she was, without becoming
God.<a id="FNanchor_1151" href="#Footnote_1151" class="fnanchor">[1151]</a></p>

<p>St. Bernardine affirms, that in order to become
mother of God, it was requisite that the holy Virgin
should be exalted to a certain equality with the divine
Persons, by a certain infinity of graces.<a id="FNanchor_1152" href="#Footnote_1152" class="fnanchor">[1152]</a> And as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_426"></a>[426]</span>
children are esteemed morally one with their parents,
so that their possessions and honors are in common,
therefore St. Peter Damian says, that if God dwells in
creatures in different modes, he dwelt in Mary in a
singular mode of fitness, making himself one with her.<a id="FNanchor_1153" href="#Footnote_1153" class="fnanchor">[1153]</a>
And he exclaims in these celebrated words: Here
let every creature be silent and tremble, and scarcely
dare to behold the immensity of so great a dignity.
God dwells in a virgin with whom he has the identity
of one nature.<a id="FNanchor_1154" href="#Footnote_1154" class="fnanchor">[1154]</a></p>

<p>St. Thomas asserts, that Mary, being made mother
of God, by reason of this close union with an infinite
good, received a certain infinite dignity, which
Father Suarez calls infinite of its kind.<a id="FNanchor_1155" href="#Footnote_1155" class="fnanchor">[1155]</a> The dignity
of mother of God is the highest dignity which can be
conferred on a pure creature. The angelic Doctor
teaches, that the humanity of Jesus Christ, though it
might have received greater habitual grace from God,
yet, as to the union with a divine Person, could not
receive greater perfection; so, on the other hand, the
blessed Virgin could receive no greater dignity than
to be the mother of God. For as habitual grace (this
is his reasoning) is a created gift, we must acknowledge<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_427"></a>[427]</span>
that its essence is finite. The capacity of every
creature is limited in measure, which however prevents
not the divine power from being able to form
another creature of greater capacity.<a id="FNanchor_1156" href="#Footnote_1156" class="fnanchor">[1156]</a> Though the
divine power may create something greater and better
than the habitual grace of Christ, yet it could not destine
it to any thing greater than was the personal
union of the only begotten Son with the Father.<a id="FNanchor_1157" href="#Footnote_1157" class="fnanchor">[1157]</a> The
blessed Virgin, because she is mother of God, has a
certain infinite dignity from the infinite good, which
is God; and in this respect nothing greater can be
created.<a id="FNanchor_1158" href="#Footnote_1158" class="fnanchor">[1158]</a> St. Thomas of Villanova says the same
thing: Certainly there is something infinite in being
the mother of the Infinite One.<a id="FNanchor_1159" href="#Footnote_1159" class="fnanchor">[1159]</a> And St. Bernardine
says, that the state to which God exalted Mary as his
mother was the highest, so that he could exalt her
no higher.<a id="FNanchor_1160" href="#Footnote_1160" class="fnanchor">[1160]</a> And this is confirmed by Albertus<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_428"></a>[428]</span>
Magnus. The Lord conferred on the blessed Virgin
the highest gift which any pure creature was capable
of receiving, namely, the maternity of God.<a id="FNanchor_1161" href="#Footnote_1161" class="fnanchor">[1161]</a></p>

<p>Therefore St. Bonaventure wrote that celebrated
sentence, that God could make a greater world, a
greater heaven, but could not exalt a creature to
greater excellence than by making her his mother.<a id="FNanchor_1162" href="#Footnote_1162" class="fnanchor">[1162]</a>
But better than all others has the divine mother herself
described the height to which God had elevated
her when she said: He that is mighty hath done great
things to me: “Fecit mihi magna qui potens est.”<a id="FNanchor_1163" href="#Footnote_1163" class="fnanchor">[1163]</a>
And why has the holy Virgin never made known
what were the great favors conferred upon her by
God? St. Thomas of Villanova answers, that Mary
did not explain them, because they were so great that
they could not be explained.<a id="FNanchor_1164" href="#Footnote_1164" class="fnanchor">[1164]</a></p>

<p>St. Bernard therefore, with reason, says that God has
created all the world for this Virgin, who was to be
his mother: “Propter hanc totus mundus factus est.”<a id="FNanchor_1165" href="#Footnote_1165" class="fnanchor">[1165]</a>
And St. Bonaventure says that the preservation of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_429"></a>[429]</span>
world is at the disposal of Mary.<a id="FNanchor_1166" href="#Footnote_1166" class="fnanchor">[1166]</a> The saint in this
place adheres to the words of Proverbs, applied by
the Church to Mary: I was with him forming all
things: “Cum eo eram cuncta componens.”<a id="FNanchor_1167" href="#Footnote_1167" class="fnanchor">[1167]</a> St.
Bernardine adds, that God, for love of Mary, did not
destroy man after the sin of Adam.<a id="FNanchor_1168" href="#Footnote_1168" class="fnanchor">[1168]</a> Hence the
Church, with reason, sings of Mary: She has chosen
the best part: “Optimam partem elegit.”<a id="FNanchor_1169" href="#Footnote_1169" class="fnanchor">[1169]</a> For this
virgin mother not only chose the best things, but she
chose the best part of the best things; the Lord
bestowing upon her, in the highest degree, as the
blessed Albertus Magnus attests, all the graces, and
the general and particular gifts conferred on all other
creatures, wholly in consequence of the dignity granted
her of becoming mother of God.<a id="FNanchor_1170" href="#Footnote_1170" class="fnanchor">[1170]</a> Thus Mary was
an infant, but of this state she had only the innocence,
but not the defect of incapacity, for from the first
moment of life she always had the perfect use of
reason. She was a virgin, but without the reproach
of sterility. She was a mother, but with the privilege
of virginity. She was beautiful, even most beautiful,
as Richard of St. Victor asserts, and also St. George<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_430"></a>[430]</span>
of Nicomedia, and St. Dionysius the Areopagite, who,
as many believe, once had the happiness of enjoying
the sight of her beauty, and said that if faith had not
taught him that she was a creature, he should have
adored her as God. And the Lord himself revealed
to St. Bridget, that the beauty of his mother surpassed
the beauty of all men and Angels, allowing the saint
to hear him say to Mary: “Thy beauty exceeds
that of all the angels, and of all creatures.”<a id="FNanchor_1171" href="#Footnote_1171" class="fnanchor">[1171]</a> She
was most beautiful, I repeat, but without injury to
those who looked upon her, for her beauty put to
flight impure emotions, and suggested even pure
thoughts, as St. Ambrose attests: So great grace had
she, that she not only preserved her own virginity,
but also conferred a remarkable gift of purity on those
who beheld her.<a id="FNanchor_1172" href="#Footnote_1172" class="fnanchor">[1172]</a> And St. Thomas confirms this:
The grace of sanctification not only repressed in the
Virgin illicit emotions, but also had efficacy for others;
so that although she was beautiful in person, she never
excited impure desires.<a id="FNanchor_1173" href="#Footnote_1173" class="fnanchor">[1173]</a> Therefore she was called
myrrh, which prevents corruption: I yielded a sweet
odor like the best myrrh: “Quasi mirrha electa dedi<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_431"></a>[431]</span>
suavitatem odoris;” as the holy Church applies it. She
was occupied in active life, but labor did not interrupt
her union with God. In the contemplative life she
was recollected in God, but without neglect of the
temporal life and of the charity due to the neighbor.
Death came upon her, but without its suffering, and
without the corruption of the body.</p>

<p>To conclude then: this divine mother is infinitely
inferior to God, but immensely superior to all creatures;
and if it is impossible to find a Son more noble
than Jesus, it is also impossible to find a mother more
noble than Mary. This should cause the servants of
such a queen not only to rejoice in her greatness, but also
to increase their confidence in her most powerful protection;
for, being mother of God, says Father Suarez,
she has a certain right to his gifts, to obtain them for
those for whom she prays.<a id="FNanchor_1174" href="#Footnote_1174" class="fnanchor">[1174]</a> St. Germanus, on the
other hand, says that God cannot but hear the prayers
of this mother, for he cannot but recognize her for
his true and immaculate mother. Thus says the saint,
addressing the Virgin: But thou, who dost prevail
with God by a maternal authority, even for those who
grievously sin, thou dost obtain the great grace of
reconciliation; for thou canst not but be graciously
heard, as God in all things conforms to thy wishes as
to those of a true and pure mother.<a id="FNanchor_1175" href="#Footnote_1175" class="fnanchor">[1175]</a> Therefore, oh<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_432"></a>[432]</span>
mother of God, and our mother, in thee is not wanting
the power to help us. The will, too, is not wanting.
Nec facultas, nec voluntas illi deesse potest.<a id="FNanchor_1176" href="#Footnote_1176" class="fnanchor">[1176]</a>
For thou knowest, I will say with thy servant the
Abbot of Celles, that God has not created thee for
himself alone, but has given thee to the angels for
their restorer, to men for their deliverer, and to the
demons for their conqueror, for by thy means we recover
divine grace, and by thee the enemy is conquered
and crushed.<a id="FNanchor_1177" href="#Footnote_1177" class="fnanchor">[1177]</a></p>

<p>And if we wish to please the divine mother, let us
often salute her by saying the “Hail Mary.” One
day Mary appeared to St. Matilda, and told her that
no one could honor her better than by this salutation;
and we shall certainly obtain through it, peculiar graces
from this mother of mercy, as will be seen by the
following example.</p>

<h5>EXAMPLE.</h5>

<p>A well-known incident is related by Father Paul
Segneri in his “Christian Instructed.”<a id="FNanchor_1178" href="#Footnote_1178" class="fnanchor">[1178]</a> A Roman
youth, of evil habits and laden with sins, went to confession<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_433"></a>[433]</span>
to Father Niccolas Zucchi. The confessor
received him kindly, compassionated his misery, and
told him that devotion to the blessed Lady would free
him from his accursed vices. He therefore imposed
it upon him as a penance, that until the time of his
next confession, every morning and evening, on rising
and going to bed, he should recite a “Hail Mary” to
the Virgin; making an offering to her of his eyes,
hands, and his whole body, praying her to keep him
as her own; and that he should kiss the ground three
times. The young man practised this penance, and
at first with very little improvement; but the father
continued to exhort him never to give it up, encouraging
him to trust in the patronage of Mary. In the
mean time, the penitent left home with some other
companions, and travelled over the world. Having
returned to Rome, he went again to seek his confessor,
who to his great joy and surprise, found him entirely
changed, and free from his former impurities. “My
son,” he said, “how have you obtained from God so
happy a change?” “Father,” answered the youth,
“the blessed Virgin, for that little devotion which you
taught me, has obtained for me this grace.” But the
wonder did not cease here. The same confessor related
this fact from the pulpit. An officer, who, for
several years, had kept up an illicit intercourse with a
certain woman, heard it, and proposed also himself to
practise the same devotion, in order to free himself
from that horrible tie which held him a slave of the
devil (which intention is necessary for all such sinners,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_434"></a>[434]</span>
that the Virgin may aid them); and he also
quitted his bad practices and changed his life.</p>

<p>But what followed? At the end of six months,
foolishly and too confidently trusting in his strength,
he wished, one day, to go and find that woman, to see
if she had also changed her way of life. But on approaching
the door of her house, where he was in
manifest danger of falling again into sin, he felt himself
thrust back by an invisible force, and soon found
himself distant from the house the whole length of the
street, and before his own door; he was then enlightened
to see clearly that Mary had thus rescued
him from his destruction. Thus we perceive how
solicitous is our good mother, not only to save us from
sin, if we for that end commend ourselves to her, but
also to protect us from the danger of falling into it
again.</p>

<h5>PRAYER.</h5>

<p>Oh immaculate and holy Virgin! oh creature the
most humble and the greatest before God! thou wast
so small in thy own eyes, but so great in the eyes of
thy Lord, that he exalted thee even to choose thee for
his mother, and therefore to make thee queen of
heaven and of earth. I then thank that God who
hath so much exalted thee, and rejoice with thee in
seeing thee so closely united to God, that more is not
permitted to a pure creature. I am ashamed to appear
before thee who art so humble, with so many
graces; I, a miserable sinner, and so proud with so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_435"></a>[435]</span>
many sins. But wretched as I am, I, too, wish to
salute thee: Hail Mary, full of grace: “Ave Maria,
gratia plena.” Thou art already full of grace; obtain
a share of it also for me. The Lord is with thee:
“Dominus tecum.” That Lord who hath ever been with
thee even from the first moment of thy creation, is now
more intimately with thee, by making himself thy Son.
Blessed art thou among women: “Benedicta tu in mulieribus.”
Oh woman, blessed among all women, obtain
for us also the divine benediction. Oh blessed
plant which hath given to the world a fruit so noble
and so holy: “Et benedictus fructus ventris tui.”
Holy Mary, mother of God: “Sancta Maria, mater
Dei.” Oh Mary, I confess that thou art the true
mother of God, and for this truth I would give my
life a thousand times. Pray for us sinners: “Ora pro
nobis peccatoribus.” But if thou art the mother of
God, thou art also the mother of our salvation, and
of us poor sinners; since it is to save sinners that God
made himself man; and he has made thee his mother
that thy prayers may have the power to save every sinner.
Pray for us, oh Mary. Now and in the hour of
our death: “Nunc et in hora mortis nostræ.” Pray
always; pray now, while we are in life, in the midst of
so many temptations and so great danger of losing God;
but still more, pray in the hour of our death, when we
are on the point of leaving this world and being presented
at the divine tribunal; that being saved by the
merits of Jesus Christ, and by thy intercession, we may
one day come, without the danger of losing thee any<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_436"></a>[436]</span>
more, to salute thee and praise thee, with thy Son, in
heaven, for all eternity. Amen.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" id="DISCOURSE_V">DISCOURSE V.<br>
<span class="smaller">ON THE VISITATION OF MARY.</span></h4>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>Mary is the treasurer of all the divine graces. Therefore he
who desires graces should have recourse to Mary; and he
who has recourse to Mary, should be secure of obtaining the
graces he wishes.</i></p>

</div>

<p>Happy is that house esteemed which is visited by
some royal personage, both for the honor it receives
from him, and the advantages it hopes for; but more
happy should that soul be called which is visited by
the queen of the world, most holy Mary, who cannot
but fill with mercies and graces those blessed souls
whom she deigns to visit with her favors. The house
of Obededom was blessed when it was visited by the
ark of the Lord: The Lord blessed his house: “Benedixit
Dominus domui ejus.”<a id="FNanchor_1179" href="#Footnote_1179" class="fnanchor">[1179]</a> But with how much
greater blessings are those persons enriched who receive
some loving visit from this living ark of God, as
was the divine mother! Happy that house which the
mother of God visits,<a id="FNanchor_1180" href="#Footnote_1180" class="fnanchor">[1180]</a> wrote Engelgrave. This was experienced
by the house of the Baptist, wherein scarcely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_437"></a>[437]</span>
had Mary entered, when she filled all that family with
celestial graces and benedictions; and for this reason,
the present feast of the Visitation is commonly called
the feast of our Lady of graces. We shall consider
to-day, in the present discourse, how the divine mother
is the treasurer of all graces. We shall divide the
discourse into two points. In the first, we shall prove
that he who desires graces must have recourse to
Mary. In the second, that he who has recourse to
Mary, should be certain of obtaining the graces that
he desires.</p>

<p><i>Point First.</i>—After the holy Virgin had heard
from the archangel St. Gabriel, that her cousin Elizabeth
had been six months pregnant, she was interiorly
enlightened by the Holy Spirit to know that the Word
which had taken human flesh and had already become
her Son, wished to commence manifesting to the world
the riches of his mercy, by the first graces that he desired
to impart to all that family. Therefore, without
interposing any delay, as St. Luke relates: Rising up,
Mary went into the mountainous country in haste:
“Exurgens abiit in montana cum festinatione.”<a id="FNanchor_1181" href="#Footnote_1181" class="fnanchor">[1181]</a>
Rising then from the quiet of her contemplation, to
which she was always devoted, and leaving her dear
solitude, she immediately set out for the house of
Elizabeth. And because holy charity suffers all things:
“Charitas omnia suffert;” and can bear no delay, as
St. Ambrose remarks, when treating of this gospel: The
grace of the Holy Spirit knows no slow movements:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_438"></a>[438]</span>
“Nescit tarda molimina Spiritus Sancti gratia:”
therefore not heeding the fatigue of the journey, the
tender and delicate maiden quickly set forth on her
way. Having arrived at that house, she saluted her
cousin: “She entered into the house of Zachary,
and saluted Elizabeth.”<a id="FNanchor_1182" href="#Footnote_1182" class="fnanchor">[1182]</a> And, as St. Ambrose remarks,
Mary was the first to salute Elizabeth: “Prior
salutavit.” But the visit of the blessed Virgin was
not like the visits of the worldly, which, for the most
part, consist in ceremonies and false display; the visit
of Mary brought into that house an abundance of
graces. For at her first entrance, and at that first
salutation, Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit,
and John was delivered from guilt and sanctified, and
therefore gave that sign of joy, exulting in the womb of
his mother; for he wished in this way to make known
the grace received by means of the blessed Virgin;
as Elizabeth herself declared: “As soon as the voice
of thy salutation sounded in my ears, the infant in my
womb leaped for joy”.<a id="FNanchor_1183" href="#Footnote_1183" class="fnanchor">[1183]</a> So, as Bernardine de Bustis
observes, in virtue of the salutation of Mary, John
received the grace of the Divine Spirit, who sanctified
him: When the blessed Virgin saluted Elizabeth,
the voice of the salutation entering through her ears,
descended to the child, by virtue of which salutation
he received the Holy Spirit.<a id="FNanchor_1184" href="#Footnote_1184" class="fnanchor">[1184]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_439"></a>[439]</span></p>

<p>Now if these first-fruits of the redemption all passed
through Mary, and she was the channel by means
of which grace was communicated to the Baptist,
the Holy Spirit to Elizabeth, the gift of prophecy
to Zachary, and so many other blessings to that
house, which were the first graces that we know to
have been given upon earth by the Word, after he
had become incarnate; we have great reason to believe
that God, even from that time, had constituted
Mary a universal channel, as St. Bernard calls her,
through which thenceforth should be dispensed to us
all the other graces which the Lord wishes to bestow
on us, as it was said in p. 1, c. 5, of this work.</p>

<p>Rightly then is this divine mother called the treasure,
the treasurer, and the dispensatrix of divine graces.
Thus she is called by the venerable Abbot of Celles:
The treasure of the Lord and the treasurer of graces:
“Thesaurus Domini, et thesauraria gratiarum.”<a id="FNanchor_1185" href="#Footnote_1185" class="fnanchor">[1185]</a> By
St. Peter Damian, also: The treasure of divine graces:
“Thesaurus divinarum gratiarum.” By blessed Albertus
Magnus: The treasurer of Jesus Christ: “Thesauraria
Jesu Christi.” By St. Bernardine: The dispensatrix
of graces: “Dispensatrix gratiarum.” By
a Greek Doctor, quoted by Petavius:<a id="FNanchor_1186" href="#Footnote_1186" class="fnanchor">[1186]</a> The store-house
of all good things: “Promptuarium omnium
bonarum.” Thus, also, St. Gregory Thaumaturgus
says: Mary is called so full of grace, because in her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_440"></a>[440]</span>
the treasure of grace was hidden.<a id="FNanchor_1187" href="#Footnote_1187" class="fnanchor">[1187]</a> And Richard of
St. Laurence says that God has placed in Mary, as in
a treasury of mercy, the gifts of all the graces, and
from this treasure he enriches his servants.<a id="FNanchor_1188" href="#Footnote_1188" class="fnanchor">[1188]</a></p>

<p>St. Bonaventure, speaking of the field of the Gospel
where the treasure is hidden which should be bought at
any great price, as Jesus Christ hath said: “The kingdom
of heaven is like unto a treasure hidden in a field,
which, when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy
thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth
that field;”<a id="FNanchor_1189" href="#Footnote_1189" class="fnanchor">[1189]</a> remarks that this field is our Queen Mary,
in whom is the treasure of God, that is, Jesus Christ,
and with Jesus Christ the source and fountain of all
graces.<a id="FNanchor_1190" href="#Footnote_1190" class="fnanchor">[1190]</a> St. Bernard also affirms that the Lord has
placed in the hands of Mary all the graces that he
wishes to dispense to us, that we may know that
whatever of good we receive, we receive it all from
her hands.<a id="FNanchor_1191" href="#Footnote_1191" class="fnanchor">[1191]</a> And of this Mary herself assures us,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_441"></a>[441]</span>
when she says: In me is all grace of the way and of
the truth: “In me gratia omnis viæ et veritatis.”<a id="FNanchor_1192" href="#Footnote_1192" class="fnanchor">[1192]</a>
In me are all the graces of true blessings that you
men can desire in your life. Yes, our mother and
our hope, well do we know, to use the words of St.
Peter Damian, that all the treasures of the divine
mercies are in thy hands.<a id="FNanchor_1193" href="#Footnote_1193" class="fnanchor">[1193]</a> And before Damian, St.
Ildephonsus asserted it with more force, for addressing
the Virgin he said to her: Oh Lady, all the
graces which God has determined to bestow upon
men, he has determined to dispense by thy hands;
and therefore has he committed to thee all the treasure
of graces.<a id="FNanchor_1194" href="#Footnote_1194" class="fnanchor">[1194]</a> Hence, oh Mary, concluded St. Germanus,
no grace is dispensed to any one except by thy
hands; no one is saved except by thee; no one receives
the gift of God except through thee.<a id="FNanchor_1195" href="#Footnote_1195" class="fnanchor">[1195]</a> The
blessed Albertus Magnus makes a beautiful reflection
upon the words of the angel to the most holy Virgin:
“Fear not, Mary, for thou hast found grace with
God,”<a id="FNanchor_1196" href="#Footnote_1196" class="fnanchor">[1196]</a> saying: Oh, Mary, thou hast not stolen grace
as Lucifer wished to steal it; thou hast not lost it as
Adam lost it; thou hast not bought it as Simon the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_442"></a>[442]</span>
Magician wished to buy it; but thou hast found it because
thou hast desired and sought it. Thou hast
found the uncreated grace, that is, God himself, become
thy Son; and at the same time thou hast found
and obtained all created good.<a id="FNanchor_1197" href="#Footnote_1197" class="fnanchor">[1197]</a> St. Peter Chrysologus
confirms this thought, by saying that the great
mother found this grace by restoring salvation to all
men.<a id="FNanchor_1198" href="#Footnote_1198" class="fnanchor">[1198]</a> And elsewhere he says, that Mary found
grace in its fulness, sufficient to save all men.<a id="FNanchor_1199" href="#Footnote_1199" class="fnanchor">[1199]</a> In
like manner as God made the sun, says Richard of
St. Laurence, that by it the earth may be illuminated,
so hath he created Mary, that by her means all divine
mercies may be dispensed to the world.<a id="FNanchor_1200" href="#Footnote_1200" class="fnanchor">[1200]</a> And St.
Bernardine adds that the Virgin, as soon as she
was made mother of the Redeemer, acquired, as it
were, a jurisdiction over all graces: when the Virgin
Mary conceived the Word of God in her womb,
she obtained, as I should say, a certain jurisdiction
over all the temporal manifestations of the Holy
Spirit; so that no creature obtained any grace from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_443"></a>[443]</span>
God, unless according to the disposal of this pious
mother.<a id="FNanchor_1201" href="#Footnote_1201" class="fnanchor">[1201]</a></p>

<p>Let us conclude this point in the words of Richard
of St. Laurence, who says, that if we wish to obtain
any grace, we must have recourse to Mary, who cannot
but obtain for her servants whatever she demands;
since she has found, and always will find, divine grace.<a id="FNanchor_1202" href="#Footnote_1202" class="fnanchor">[1202]</a>
And this he took from St. Bernard, who said: Let
us seek grace, and let us seek it through Mary, for
what she seeks she finds, and cannot be frustrated.<a id="FNanchor_1203" href="#Footnote_1203" class="fnanchor">[1203]</a>
If, then, we desire graces, we must go to this treasurer
and dispensatrix of graces; for this is the sovereign
will of the Giver of every good, as St. Bernard
himself assures us, that all graces are dispensed by
the hand of Mary.<a id="FNanchor_1204" href="#Footnote_1204" class="fnanchor">[1204]</a> All, all: Totum, totum; he who
says all, excludes nothing. But, because confidence
is necessary in order to obtain grace, we now will pass
on to consider how certain we should be of obtaining
graces, if we have recourse to Mary.</p>

<p><i>Second Point.</i>—And why should Jesus Christ ever<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_444"></a>[444]</span>
have placed in the hands of this his mother all the
riches of the mercies which he wishes to use for our
benefit, if not that she may enrich with them all her
servants who love and honor her, and with confidence
recur to her? With me are riches ... that I may
enrich them that love me: “Mecum sunt divitiæ ...
ut ditem diligentes me.”<a id="FNanchor_1205" href="#Footnote_1205" class="fnanchor">[1205]</a> Thus the Virgin herself
speaks in this passage, which the holy Church applies
to her on so many of her festivals. Therefore, for no
other use, but for our benefit, says Adam the Abbot,
are the riches of eternal life preserved by Mary, in
whose bosom the Saviour has deposited the treasure
of the wretched, that, supplied from this treasure, the
poor may become rich.<a id="FNanchor_1206" href="#Footnote_1206" class="fnanchor">[1206]</a> And St. Bernard adds, as
I learn from another author, that for this purpose
Mary has been given to the world, for a channel of
mercy, that by her means graces may continually descend
from heaven upon men.<a id="FNanchor_1207" href="#Footnote_1207" class="fnanchor">[1207]</a></p>

<p>From this the holy Father goes on to ask, why St.
Gabriel, having found the divine mother already full
of grace, according to his salutation: Hail, full of
grace: “Ave gratia plena;” afterwards says that the
Holy Spirit was to come to her, to fill her still more
with grace; if she was already full of this grace,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_445"></a>[445]</span>
what more could the coming of the Holy Spirit effect?
Mary was already full of grace, thus answers St. Bernard,
but the Holy Spirit came upon her for our good,
that from her superabundance we poor sinners might
be provided.<a id="FNanchor_1208" href="#Footnote_1208" class="fnanchor">[1208]</a> For this reason Mary was called the
moon, of which it is said: The moon is full, for herself
and others: “Luna plena sibi, et aliis.”</p>

<p>“He that shall find me, shall find life, and shall
have salvation from the Lord.”<a id="FNanchor_1209" href="#Footnote_1209" class="fnanchor">[1209]</a> Blessed is he who
having recourse to me finds me, says our mother. He
will find life, and will find it easily; for, as it is easy
to find and draw water (as much as one wishes) from
a great fountain, so it is easy to find graces and eternal
salvation by going to Mary. A holy soul hath
said, we have only to ask graces of our Lady and we
shall have them. And St. Bernard says, that before
Mary was born, the world was without this abundance
of graces, that now are overflowing the earth, because
this desirable channel (Mary) was wanting.<a id="FNanchor_1210" href="#Footnote_1210" class="fnanchor">[1210]</a> But now
that we actually have this mother of mercy, what
graces can we not obtain, if we cast ourselves at her
feet? I am the city of refuge, thus St. John of
Damascus makes her to say, for all those who have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_446"></a>[446]</span>
recourse to me: come, then, my children, and you
will obtain from me graces, in greater abundance than
you can imagine.<a id="FNanchor_1211" href="#Footnote_1211" class="fnanchor">[1211]</a></p>

<p>It is true that many experience what the venerable
Sister Maria Villani saw in a heavenly vision. This
servant of God once saw the mother of God, in the
likeness of a great fountain, to which many went to
draw the waters of graces; but what then happened?
Those who carried vessels which were whole, preserved
afterwards the graces received; but those who carry
broken vessels, that is, souls laden with sins, received
the graces, but quickly lost them again. As for
the rest, it is certain that by means of Mary, men,
even the most ungrateful and wretched sinners, daily
obtain innumerable graces. St. Augustine says, addressing
the Virgin: Through thee the wretched obtain
mercy, the ungrateful grace, sinners pardon, the
weak support, the earthly heavenly things, mortals life,
and travellers their country.<a id="FNanchor_1212" href="#Footnote_1212" class="fnanchor">[1212]</a></p>

<p>Let our confidence, then, ever revive, oh devoted
servants of Mary, as often as we have recourse to her
for graces. And to revive this confidence, let us ever
remember the two great privileges which this good
mother possesses, namely: the desire she has to do us<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_447"></a>[447]</span>
good, and the power she has with her Son to obtain
whatever she asks. That we may know the desire
Mary has to aid all, it would be sufficient only to consider
the mystery of the present festival, namely, the
visit of Mary to Elizabeth. The journey from Nazareth,
where the most holy Virgin lived, to the city of
Hebron (called by St. Luke a city of Judah), where,
according to Baronius and other authors, Elizabeth
dwelt, was about sixty-nine miles, as the author of the
Life of Mary, Father Giuseppe of Jesus, one of the barefooted
Carmelites, asserts,<a id="FNanchor_1213" href="#Footnote_1213" class="fnanchor">[1213]</a> as also Bede and Brocardo.
But this did not prevent the blessed Virgin, tender
and delicate as she then was, and not accustomed to
such efforts, from immediately setting forth—moved by
what?—moved by that great charity with which her
most tender heart was ever filled, to go and commence
from that time her great office of dispenser of graces.
Precisely thus does St. Ambrose speak of this her
journey: She did not go as if incredulous of the announcement,
but happy in her desire, hastening for
joy, and intent upon her office.<a id="FNanchor_1214" href="#Footnote_1214" class="fnanchor">[1214]</a> Not that Mary, as
the saint says, went to inform herself of the truth of
what the angel had told her concerning Elizabeth, but
joyful through her desire to help that household, hastening
for the joy she felt to do good to others, and
wholly intent on that charitable errand. Rising up,
she went with haste: “Exurgens abiit cum festinatione.”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_448"></a>[448]</span>
Here let it be observed that the Evangelist,
when he spoke of Mary going to the house of Elizabeth,
said that she went in haste: Abiit festinatione;
but speaking of her return from that house, he makes
no more mention of haste, but simply says: “And
Mary abode with her about three months, and she returned
to her own house.”<a id="FNanchor_1215" href="#Footnote_1215" class="fnanchor">[1215]</a> What other object, then,
says St. Bonaventure, caused the mother of God to
hasten when going to visit the house of the Baptist,
except the desire to do good to that family?<a id="FNanchor_1216" href="#Footnote_1216" class="fnanchor">[1216]</a></p>

<p>Certainly, since the assumption of Mary into heaven,
this her affection of charity towards men has not
ceased; nay, it has ever been increasing, for there
she better knows our necessities, and feels more pity
for our miseries. Bernardine de Bustis writes, that
Mary more earnestly desires to do us good than we
desire to receive it from her.<a id="FNanchor_1217" href="#Footnote_1217" class="fnanchor">[1217]</a> To such a degree, that
St. Bonaventure says, she considers herself injured by
those who do not ask favors of her;<a id="FNanchor_1218" href="#Footnote_1218" class="fnanchor">[1218]</a> for this is the
desire of Mary, to enrich all with her graces; for, indeed,
according to the assertion of the Idiot, she
superabundantly enriches her servants.<a id="FNanchor_1219" href="#Footnote_1219" class="fnanchor">[1219]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_449"></a>[449]</span></p>

<p>Hence the same author says, that he who finds
Mary finds every good: “Inventa Maria, invenitur
omne bonum.” And he adds, that every one can find
her, were he even the most abandoned sinner in the
world; for she is so gracious that she sends away
none who have recourse to her.<a id="FNanchor_1220" href="#Footnote_1220" class="fnanchor">[1220]</a> I invite all to come
to me, thus Thomas à Kempis makes her say, I wait
for all, I wish that all may come; neither do I ever
despise any sinner who comes to seek my help, however
unworthy he may be.<a id="FNanchor_1221" href="#Footnote_1221" class="fnanchor">[1221]</a> All who go to her asking
favors, says Richard, will find her always ready,
always inclined to succor them, and obtain for them
every grace of eternal salvation by her powerful prayers:
“Inveniet semper paratam auxiliari.”</p>

<p>I have said by her powerful prayers, for this is the
other reflection which should increase our confidence,
namely, knowing that she obtains from God whatever
she asks in favor of her servants. Observe especially,
says St. Bonaventure, in this visit that Mary made to
Elizabeth, the great virtue of the words of Mary; for at
the sound of her voice the grace of the Holy Spirit was
given to Elizabeth as well as to her son, as the Evangelist
has written: “And it came to pass that when
Elizabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the infant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_450"></a>[450]</span>
leaped in her womb, and Elizabeth was filled with the
Holy Ghost.”<a id="FNanchor_1222" href="#Footnote_1222" class="fnanchor">[1222]</a> On which St. Bonaventure remarks:
Behold, how great is the virtue of the words of our
Lady, for at the sound of them the Holy Spirit is
given.<a id="FNanchor_1223" href="#Footnote_1223" class="fnanchor">[1223]</a> Theophilus of Alexandria says that Jesus is
much pleased when Mary prays to him for us, for
then all the graces which he bestows on us through
the supplications of Mary, he does not consider to be
conferred on us, but rather on Mary herself.<a id="FNanchor_1224" href="#Footnote_1224" class="fnanchor">[1224]</a> And
let these words be noted: Persuaded by the prayers
of his mother, he gives: “Precibus suæ genitricis
evictus, donat.” Yes, because Jesus, as St. Germanus
attests, cannot but graciously hear Mary in all her petitions,
wishing in this, as it were, to obey her as his
true mother; hence the saint says, that the prayers of
this mother have a certain authority with Jesus Christ,
so that she obtains pardon even for the greatest sinners,
who commend themselves to her.<a id="FNanchor_1225" href="#Footnote_1225" class="fnanchor">[1225]</a></p>

<p>And this is indeed confirmed, as St. John Chrysostom
observes, by what took place at the nuptials of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_451"></a>[451]</span>
Cana, where Mary, asking of her Son the wine that
was wanting, said: “They have no wine;” Jesus answered:
“Woman, what is that to me and to thee?
my hour is not yet come.”<a id="FNanchor_1226" href="#Footnote_1226" class="fnanchor">[1226]</a> But although the time
for miracles had not yet arrived, as Chrysostom and
Theophilactus explain; yet, says the same Chrysostom,
our Saviour, in order to obey his mother, performed
the miracle she requested, and converted the
water into wine.<a id="FNanchor_1227" href="#Footnote_1227" class="fnanchor">[1227]</a></p>

<p>“Let us go therefore,” thus the apostle exhorts us,
“with confidence to the throne of grace; that we may
obtain mercy, and find grace in seasonable aid.”<a id="FNanchor_1228" href="#Footnote_1228" class="fnanchor">[1228]</a>
The throne of grace is the blessed Virgin Mary, says
the blessed Albertus Magnus: “Thronus gratiæ est
beata Virgo Maria.”<a id="FNanchor_1229" href="#Footnote_1229" class="fnanchor">[1229]</a> If, then, we wish for graces, let
us go to the throne of grace, which is Mary; and let
us go with the hope of being certainly heard; for we
have the intercession of Mary, who obtains whatever
she asks of her Son. Let us ask for grace, I repeat
with St. Bernard, and through Mary let us ask:
“Quæramus gratiam et per Mariam quæramus,” trusting
to what the Virgin mother said to St. Matilda,
that the Holy Spirit, filling her with all his sweetness,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_452"></a>[452]</span>
had rendered her so dear to God that every one who,
through her intercession, asked for graces, would certainly
obtain them.<a id="FNanchor_1230" href="#Footnote_1230" class="fnanchor">[1230]</a></p>

<p>And if we give credit to that celebrated saying of
St. Anselm: We shall sometimes find grace sooner by
having recourse to Mary, than by having recourse to
our Saviour Jesus himself;<a id="FNanchor_1231" href="#Footnote_1231" class="fnanchor">[1231]</a> not that he is not the
source and Lord of all graces, but because if we go
to Mary, and she intercedes for us, her prayers will
have more power, as the prayers of a mother, than
ours. Let us never then leave the feet of this treasurer
of graces, but say to her with St. John Damascene:
Open to us, oh blessed mother of God, the
door of thy mercy, for thou art the salvation of the
human race.<a id="FNanchor_1232" href="#Footnote_1232" class="fnanchor">[1232]</a> Oh mother of God, open to us the
door of thy mercy, by praying always for us; for thy
prayers are the salvation of all men. And when we
have recourse to Mary, it would be best to ask her to
pray for us, and obtain for us those graces which she
knows are most expedient for our salvation; which is
precisely what Brother Reginald, a Dominican, did, as
is related in the chronicles of the order.<a id="FNanchor_1233" href="#Footnote_1233" class="fnanchor">[1233]</a> This servant
of Mary was infirm, and asked of her the grace<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_453"></a>[453]</span>
of bodily health. Our Lady appeared to him, accompanied
by St. Cecilia and St. Catherine, and said to
him with the greatest sweetness: “My son, what shall
I do for thee?” The religious at this kind offer of
Mary was troubled, and knew not what to answer.
Then one of those saints gave him this counsel: “Reginald,
do you know what you should do? Do not
ask for any thing, place every thing at her disposal,
because Mary knows how to obtain for thee a grace
greater than you could ask.” The sick brother followed
her advice, and the divine mother obtained for
him the grace of health.</p>

<p>But if we also desire the happy visits of this queen
of heaven, it will greatly aid us if we often visit her
before some image, or in some church dedicated to her.
Let us read the following example, and learn with
what special favors she rewards the devout visits of
her servants.</p>

<h5>EXAMPLE.</h5>

<p>It is related in the Franciscan chronicles, that two
religious of that order, who were going to visit a sanctuary
of the Virgin, were overtaken by night in a great
wood; where they became bewildered and so troubled
that they knew not what to do. But advancing a
little, they discerned through the darkness something
which seemed to them a house. They went groping
along with outstretched hands, and at length touched
a wall; they found the door, knocked, and heard some
one within asking who they were? They answered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_454"></a>[454]</span>
that they were two poor religious who had lost their
way by accident in that wood, and were seeking a
shelter, that at least they might not be devoured by
wolves. But suddenly they heard the door open, and
saw two pages richly dressed, who received them with
great courtesy. The religious asked them who inhabited
that palace? The pages answered that a very
kind, good Lady inhabited it. We wish to pay our
respects to her, said they, and thank her for her
charity. We will take you to her, said the pages, for
she too wishes to speak to you. They ascended the
stairs, found the apartments all illuminated, richly
furnished, and perfumed as with an odor of paradise;
they finally entered the apartment of the Lady, who
was majestic and most lovely in her appearance, and
who welcomed them with the greatest kindness, and
then asked them in what direction they were travelling?
They answered that they were going to visit a
certain church of the blessed Virgin. If that is the
case, said the Lady, when you go I will give you a
letter from myself, which will greatly aid you. And
whilst the Lady was speaking to them, they felt all
inflamed with love of God, and filled with a joy such
as they had never before experienced. They afterwards
went to rest, if perchance they could sleep in
the midst of so much joy, and in the morning they
went again to take leave of the Lady of the mansion,
thank her, and at the same time receive the letter:
they did so and departed. But when they had gone
a little distance from the house, they perceived that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_455"></a>[455]</span>
there was no superscription to the letter; but they
turned and returned, and could not find the house
again. At last they opened the letter, to see to whom
it was sent, and what it contained, and found that
it was from the most holy Mary, and was written
to themselves, and let them know that she was the
Lady whom they saw the night before, and that on
account of the devotion they cherished for her, she
had provided a house and refreshment for them in that
wood. She exhorted them to continue to serve and
love her, for she would well reward their devotion,
and assist them in life and in death. At the bottom
of the letter they read the signature of the Virgin
Mary. We may easily imagine the thanks that those
good religious offered to the divine mother, and how
greatly they were inflamed with the desire of loving
her and serving her to the end of their lives.</p>

<h5>PRAYER.</h5>

<p>Immaculate and blessed Virgin, since thou art the
universal dispenser of all divine graces, therefore thou
art the hope of all, and also my hope. I always
thank my Lord that he hath given me to know thee,
and the means that I must use to obtain graces and
save myself. Thou art this means, oh great mother
of God, for I now understand that it is principally
through the merits of Jesus Christ, and after those,
through thy intercession, that I am to be saved. Ah,
my queen, thou didst make so great haste to visit,
and sanctify with thy visit, the house of Elizabeth;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_456"></a>[456]</span>
ah, visit, and visit quickly, the poor house of my soul.
Ah, hasten! thou knowest better than I how poor it
is, how infected with many maladies, with irregular
affections, bad habits, and actual sin, all those fatal
diseases which will bring it to eternal death. Thou
canst enrich it, oh treasurer of God! and thou canst
heal all its infirmities. Visit me then in life, and
visit me especially at the hour of my death, for then
thy help will be more necessary to me. I do not,
indeed expect, neither am I worthy that thou shouldst
visit me on this earth with thy visible presence, as thou
hast done to so many of thy servants, but servants
not so unworthy and ungrateful as I am. I will be
content to be allowed then to see thee in thy kingdom
of heaven, there to love thee better, and thank
thee for whatever good thou hast done me. At
present I will be content that thou shouldst visit me
with thy mercies. It is enough that thou dost pray
for me.</p>

<p>Pray for me then oh Mary, and commend me to
thy Son. Thou knowest better than I know myself,
my miseries and my necessities. What more would I
say to thee? Have pity on me. I am so miserable
and ignorant that I do not even know, and cannot
even ask, the graces that are most necessary for me.
Oh my queen and most sweet mother, ask thou and
obtain for me, from thy Son, those graces which thou
knowest to be most useful and necessary for my soul.
Into thy hands I entirely abandon myself, and only
pray the divine Majesty, that through the merits of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_457"></a>[457]</span>
my Saviour Jesus, he may grant me those graces that
thou dost ask of him for me. Ask, ask then for me,
oh most holy Virgin, whatever thou esteemest best.
Thy prayers are never rejected. They are the prayers
of a mother to a Son, who loves thee so much, and
finds his joy in granting whatever thou dost ask of
him, thus the more to honor thee, and at the same
time, show thee the great love he bears thee. Oh
Lady, thus let it be. I will live trusting in thee.
Thou must think only on saving me. Amen.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" id="DISCOURSE_VI">DISCOURSE VI.<br>
<span class="smaller">ON THE PURIFICATION OF MARY.</span></h4>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>The great sacrifice which Mary this day made to God, in offering
him the life of her Son.</i></p>

</div>

<p>There were two precepts of the ancient law concerning
the birth of first-born sons. One was, that
the mother should remain as an unclean person, retired
in her house, for forty days; after which she
should go to purify herself in the temple. The other
was, that the parents of the first-born should take him
to the temple, and there offer him to God. On this
day the most holy Virgin desired to obey both precepts.
Although Mary was not bound by the law of
purification, since she was always a virgin, and always
pure; yet, by her love of humility and obedience, she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_458"></a>[458]</span>
wished to go, like other mothers, to be purified. At
the same time she obeyed the second precept, to present
and offer her Son to the eternal Father: “And
after the days of her purification, according to the law
of Moses, were accomplished, they carried him to Jerusalem,
to present him to the Lord.”<a id="FNanchor_1234" href="#Footnote_1234" class="fnanchor">[1234]</a> But the
Virgin offered him in a different manner from that in
which other mothers offered their sons. Others offered
them, but they knew that this was a simple ceremony
of the law, through which, by redeeming them, they
made them their own, without the fear that they
should be obliged to offer them again, and to death.
Mary really offered her Son to death, knowing certainly
that the sacrifice of the life of Jesus which she
then made, should one day be actually consummated
upon the altar of the cross; so that Mary, by offering
the life of her Son, through the love she bore this
Son, really sacrificed herself entirely to God. Laying
aside, then, all the other considerations which we might
make upon the various mysteries of this festival, let
us only consider how great was this sacrifice that Mary
made of herself to God, by offering to him, on this
day, the life of her Son. And this will be the only
subject of the following discourse.</p>

<p>The eternal Father had already determined to save
man, who was lost through sin, and free him from
eternal death. But because he wished that, at the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_459"></a>[459]</span>
same time, his divine justice should not be defrauded of
a full and due satisfaction, he did not spare the life
of his own Son, already made man in order to redeem
man; but he required that he should pay, to its most
rigorous extent, the penalty merited by men: “He
that spared not even his own Son,” says the apostle,
“but delivered him up for us all.”<a id="FNanchor_1235" href="#Footnote_1235" class="fnanchor">[1235]</a> He sent him
therefore on the earth to become man, destined for
him a mother, and chose the Virgin Mary; but as he
did not wish his divine Word to become her Son before
she accepted him by her express consent, so he
did not wish that Jesus should sacrifice his life for the
salvation of men without the concurrence of the consent
of Mary, that together with the sacrifice of the
life of the Son, the heart of the mother might be sacrificed
also. St. Thomas teaches, that the relation of
mother gives an especial right over her children; hence
Jesus, being innocent in himself and not deserving any
punishment for his own sins, it seemed fitting that he
should not be destined to the cross as the victim for
the sins of the world without the consent of his
mother, by which she should voluntarily offer him to
death.</p>

<p>But although Mary, from the moment she was
made mother of Jesus, gave her consent to his death,
yet the Lord wished her, on this day, to make, in the
temple, a solemn sacrifice of herself, by offering solemnly
her Son, and sacrificing to the divine justice<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_460"></a>[460]</span>
his precious life. Hence St. Epiphanius called her a
priest: “Virginem appello velut sacerdotem.”<a id="FNanchor_1236" href="#Footnote_1236" class="fnanchor">[1236]</a> Now
we begin to see how much this sacrifice cost her, and
what heroic virtue she was obliged to practice when
she had herself to sign the sentence of condemnation
of her dear Jesus to death.</p>

<p>Now behold Mary actually on her way to Jerusalem
to offer her Son; she hastens her steps towards
the place of sacrifice, and she herself carries her beloved
victim in her arms. She enters the temple, approaches
the altar, and there, filled with modesty,
humility, and devotion, she presents her Son to the
Most High. At this moment St. Simeon, who had
received the promise from God that he should not die
before seeing the expected Messias, takes the divine
child from the hands of the Virgin, and, enlightened
by the Holy Spirit, announces to her how much sorrow
this sacrifice must cause her, this sacrifice which
she was about to make of her Son, with whom must
her blessed soul also be sacrificed. Here St. Thomas
of Villanova contemplates the holy old man, who,
when he had to announce the fatal prophecy to this
poor mother, is agitated and silent.<a id="FNanchor_1237" href="#Footnote_1237" class="fnanchor">[1237]</a> Then the saint
considers Mary, who asks: Why, oh Simeon, in the
time of so great consolation, are you thus disturbed?
“Unde tanta turbatio?” To whom he answers: Oh,
noble and holy Virgin, I wished not to announce to
thee such bitter tidings, but since the Lord wishes it
thus, for thy greater merit, hear what I say to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_461"></a>[461]</span>
thee.<a id="FNanchor_1238" href="#Footnote_1238" class="fnanchor">[1238]</a> This infant who now causes thee, and with reason,
so much joy, oh God, shall one day bring thee the
most cruel suffering that any creature has ever experienced
in the world; and this will be when thou shalt
see him persecuted by men of every sort, and placed
on the earth as the mark of their sneers and derision,
even until he is put to death before thy eyes.<a id="FNanchor_1239" href="#Footnote_1239" class="fnanchor">[1239]</a> Know
that after his death there will be many martyrs
who, for love of this thy Son, will be tormented and
slain; but if their martyrdom will be of the body, thy
martyrdom, oh divine mother, will be of the heart.<a id="FNanchor_1240" href="#Footnote_1240" class="fnanchor">[1240]</a></p>

<p>Yes, of the heart, for nothing but compassion for
the sufferings of this Son so dear could be meant by
the sword of sorrow that St. Simeon predicted was to
pierce the heart of the mother: “And thy own soul
a sword shall pierce.”<a id="FNanchor_1241" href="#Footnote_1241" class="fnanchor">[1241]</a> Already the most holy Virgin,
as St. Jerome says, had been enlightened through
the divine Scriptures to know the sufferings which the
Redeemer was to endure in his life, and still more at
the time of his death. She well understood from the
prophets, that he was to be betrayed by one of his
friends: “Who ate my bread hath greatly supplanted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_462"></a>[462]</span>
me;”<a id="FNanchor_1242" href="#Footnote_1242" class="fnanchor">[1242]</a> as David predicted. Abandoned by his disciples:
Strike the shepherd, and the sheep shall be
scattered: “Percute Pastorem, et dispergentur oves.”<a id="FNanchor_1243" href="#Footnote_1243" class="fnanchor">[1243]</a>
Well did she know the insults, spitting, blows, and derision
that he was to suffer from the people: “I have
given my body to the strikers, and my cheeks to them
that plucked them; I have not turned away my face
from them that rebuked me and spit upon me.”<a id="FNanchor_1244" href="#Footnote_1244" class="fnanchor">[1244]</a> She
knew that he was to become the scandal of men, and
the outcast of the lowest of the people: “But I am a
worm and no man, the reproach of men and the outcast
of the people,”<a id="FNanchor_1245" href="#Footnote_1245" class="fnanchor">[1245]</a> even to be laden with insults
and outrages: “He shall be filled with reproaches.”<a id="FNanchor_1246" href="#Footnote_1246" class="fnanchor">[1246]</a>
She knew that at the end of his life his sacred flesh
would be torn and bruised by scourges: “He was
wounded for our iniquities, he was bruised for our
sins,”<a id="FNanchor_1247" href="#Footnote_1247" class="fnanchor">[1247]</a> so that his body would be wholly disfigured
by them, become as a leper, all sores: “There is no
beauty in him, nor comeliness, and we have thought
him, as it were, a leper,”<a id="FNanchor_1248" href="#Footnote_1248" class="fnanchor">[1248]</a> even till the bones were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_463"></a>[463]</span>
uncovered: “They have numbered all my bones.”<a id="FNanchor_1249" href="#Footnote_1249" class="fnanchor">[1249]</a>
She knew that he was to be pierced by nails.<a id="FNanchor_1250" href="#Footnote_1250" class="fnanchor">[1250]</a> That
he was to be reputed with the wicked.<a id="FNanchor_1251" href="#Footnote_1251" class="fnanchor">[1251]</a> And that
finally he was to die, hanging on the cross, slain for
the salvation of men: “And they shall look upon me
whom they have pierced.”<a id="FNanchor_1252" href="#Footnote_1252" class="fnanchor">[1252]</a></p>

<p>Mary, I repeat, already knew all the sufferings that
her Son was to endure, but in the above quoted words
of St. Simeon: “And thy own soul a sword shall
pierce,” as the Lord revealed to St. Theresa, all the
minute circumstances of the external as well as internal
sufferings which her Lord Jesus was to endure in
his passion, were made known to her. She consented
to all with a firmness which made the angels wonder,
and pronounced the sentence that her Son should die,
and die by a death so ignominious and painful, in these
words: Eternal Father, since thou dost will it, not
my will, but thine be done: “Non mea voluntas, sed
tua fiat;” I unite mine to thy holy will, and sacrifice
to thee this my Son; I am satisfied that he should
lose his life for thy glory, and for the salvation of the
world. And I also sacrifice to thee my heart; let
grief pierce it as much as pleases thee; it suffices to
me that thou, oh my God, art glorified and satisfied;
not my will, but thine be done. Oh, charity without
measure! oh, constancy without example! oh,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_464"></a>[464]</span>
victory that merits the eternal admiration of heaven
and of earth!</p>

<p>And hence Mary, in the passion of Jesus, was silent
when he was unjustly accused; she said nothing to
Pilate, who was inclined to liberate him, for he had
already known his innocence; but she only appeared
in public to be present at the great sacrifice, which
was to be offered on Calvary. She accompanied him
to the place of punishment; she was with him from
the first moment he was placed upon the cross: There
stood by the cross of Jesus his mother: “Stabat
juxta crucem Jesu mater ejus;” until she saw him
expire, and the sacrifice was consummated. And all
this to complete the offering which she had already
made of him to God in the temple.</p>

<p>In order to understand the violence that Mary had
to offer herself in making this sacrifice, it would be
necessary to comprehend the love which this mother
bore to Jesus. Generally speaking, the love of
mothers is so tender for their children, that when
they are at the point of death, and they are about to
lose them, they forget all their faults, their defects,
and even the injuries they have received from them,
and they suffer an inexpressible grief. And yet the
love of those mothers is a love divided among other
children, or among other creatures. Mary has one
only Son, and he is the most beautiful of all the
children of Adam; he is most amiable, for he has all
lovable qualities; he is obedient, virtuous, innocent,
holy, in one word, he is God. The love of this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_465"></a>[465]</span>
mother, too, is not divided among other objects; she
has centered all her love upon this only Son, neither
does she fear loving him to excess, for this her Son is
God, who merits an infinite love. And this Son is the
victim whom she had voluntarily to offer to death.</p>

<p>Let every one consider, then, how much it must
have cost Mary to sacrifice on the cross the life of a
Son so amiable, and what strength of mind she must
have exercised in this act. Behold the most fortunate
of mothers, because she is the mother of a God, but
she is at the same time a mother most worthy of compassion,
because the most afflicted; being the mother
of a Son whom she saw destined to the cross from
the day when he was given her for a Son! What
mother would accept a son, knowing that afterwards
she should lose him by such a painful and infamous
death, and that she should be present to see him
die? Mary willingly accepted this Son with so hard
a condition; and not only accepted him, but offers
him herself this day, with her own hands, to death,
sacrificing him to the divine justice. St. Bonaventure
says, that the blessed Virgin would willingly
have taken upon herself the sufferings and death of her
Son; but to obey God she made the great offering of
the divine life of her beloved Jesus, conquering, but
with the greatest grief, all the tenderness of love that
she bore him.<a id="FNanchor_1253" href="#Footnote_1253" class="fnanchor">[1253]</a> Hence it is, that in this offering Mary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_466"></a>[466]</span>
had to do more violence to herself, and was more
generous, than if she had offered herself to suffer all
her Son was to suffer. Therefore she surpassed all
the martyrs in generosity, for the martyrs offered their
own lives; but the Virgin offered the life of her Son,
whom she loved and esteemed infinitely more than
her own life.</p>

<p>Neither did the suffering of this painful offering end
here; rather it commenced here; for from that time
forward, through the whole life of her Son, Mary had
always before her eyes death, and all the pains he was
to suffer in his death. Hence, the more this Son discovered
to her how beautiful, graceful, and amiable
he was, so much more did the anguish of her heart
constantly increase. Ah, afflicted mother! if thou
hadst loved thy Son less, or if thy Son had been less
lovely, and had loved thee less, thy suffering would
certainly have been less in offering him to death. But
there never has been, and there never will be, a
more loving mother than thou, because there never
has been, and never will be, a son more amiable
and more loving towards his mother than thy Jesus.
Oh God! if we had seen the beauty, the majesty of
countenance of that divine child, could we have had
the courage to sacrifice his life for our salvation? And
thou, oh Mary! who art his mother, and a mother so
loving, couldst thou offer thy innocent Son for the
salvation of men, to a death more painful and more
cruel than any criminal had ever endured on this
earth?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_467"></a>[467]</span></p>

<p>Alas! what a fearful scene from that day forward
did love continually place before the eyes of Mary,
representing to her all the injuries and mockeries
which were to be offered to her poor Son! Behold
love already representing him to her in his agony in
the garden, then torn by scourges, and crowned with
thorns in the hall of Pilate, and finally hanging from
the infamous wood on Calvary! Behold, oh mother,
said love, what a lovely and innocent Son thou hast
offered to such sufferings, and to so dreadful a death!
And of what avail will it be to thee to rescue him
from the hands of Herod, in order to reserve him for
so piteous an end?</p>

<p>Thus Mary not only offered her Son to death in the
temple, but was offering him up at every moment of
her life; for she revealed to St. Bridget, that this
grief which St. Simeon announced to her, never left
her heart till she was assumed into heaven.<a id="FNanchor_1254" href="#Footnote_1254" class="fnanchor">[1254]</a> Hence
St. Anselm says: Oh Lady, I cannot believe, that
with such a sorrow thou wouldst have been able to
live one moment, if God himself, who gives life, had
not strengthened thee by his divine power.<a id="FNanchor_1255" href="#Footnote_1255" class="fnanchor">[1255]</a> And St.
Bernard affirms, speaking of the great sorrow that
Mary endured on this day, that henceforth she suffered
a living death, bearing a grief more cruel than death.<a id="FNanchor_1256" href="#Footnote_1256" class="fnanchor">[1256]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_468"></a>[468]</span>
She lived, dying at every moment, because grief for
the death of her beloved Jesus, which was more cruel
than any death, was at every moment assailing her.</p>

<p>The divine mother then, on account of the great
merit she acquired in this great sacrifice, which she
made to God for the salvation of the world, was justly
called by St. Augustine: The restorer of the human
race: “Reparatrix generis humani.”<a id="FNanchor_1257" href="#Footnote_1257" class="fnanchor">[1257]</a> By St. Epiphanius:
The redeemer of captives: “Redemptrix
captivorum.”<a id="FNanchor_1258" href="#Footnote_1258" class="fnanchor">[1258]</a> By St. Ildephonsus: The restorer of
the ruined world: “Reparatrix perditi orbis.”<a id="FNanchor_1259" href="#Footnote_1259" class="fnanchor">[1259]</a> By
St. Germanus: The consolation of our miseries:
“Restauratio calamitatum nostrarum.”<a id="FNanchor_1260" href="#Footnote_1260" class="fnanchor">[1260]</a> By St. Ambrose:
The mother of all believers: “Mater omnium
credentium.”<a id="FNanchor_1261" href="#Footnote_1261" class="fnanchor">[1261]</a> By St. Augustine: The mother of
the living: “Mater viventium.”<a id="FNanchor_1262" href="#Footnote_1262" class="fnanchor">[1262]</a> By St. Andrew of
Crete: The mother of life: “Mater vitæ.”<a id="FNanchor_1263" href="#Footnote_1263" class="fnanchor">[1263]</a> For, as
St. Arnold Carnotensis says: In the death of Jesus,
Mary united her will to that of her Son in such a
manner, that both offered the same sacrifice; and
therefore the holy abbot says, that thus the Son and
the mother effected the human redemption, obtaining
salvation for men.<a id="FNanchor_1264" href="#Footnote_1264" class="fnanchor">[1264]</a> Jesus by satisfying for our sins,
Mary by obtaining for us that this satisfaction should<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_469"></a>[469]</span>
be applied to us. And hence blessed Denis the Carthusian
likewise affirms, that the divine mother may
be called the salvation of the world, since by the
pain she endured in commiserating her Son (voluntarily
sacrificed by her to divine justice), she merited
that the merits of the Redeemer should be communicated
to men.<a id="FNanchor_1265" href="#Footnote_1265" class="fnanchor">[1265]</a></p>

<p>Mary, then, having been made the mother of all
the redeemed, by the merit of her sufferings, and of
the offering of her Son; it is just to believe that only
by her hand may be given them the milk of those
divine graces, which are the fruits of the merits of
Jesus Christ, and the means to obtain life eternal.
And it is to this that St. Bernard alludes, when he
says that God has placed in the hands of Mary the
whole price of our redemption.<a id="FNanchor_1266" href="#Footnote_1266" class="fnanchor">[1266]</a> By which the saint
gives us to understand, that by means of the intercession
of the blessed Virgin, the merits of the Redeemer
are applied to souls, as by her hand these
graces are dispensed, which are precisely the price of
the merits of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>And if the sacrifice of Abraham in offering up to
him his son Isaac so pleased God that he promised,
as a reward, to multiply his descendants as the stars<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_470"></a>[470]</span>
of heaven: “Because thou hast done this thing, and
hast not spared thy only begotten Son for my sake;
I will bless thee, and I will multiply thy seed as the
stars of heaven;”<a id="FNanchor_1267" href="#Footnote_1267" class="fnanchor">[1267]</a> we must certainly believe that
the more remarkable sacrifice which this great mother
made of Jesus was much more agreeable to the Lord;
and, therefore, it has been granted her, that by her
prayers, the number of the elect should be multiplied,
that is, the favored succession of her children,
for she holds and protects as such her devoted servants.</p>

<p>St. Simeon received a promise from God that he
should not die until he had seen the Messiah born:
“And he had received an answer from the Holy
Ghost, that he should not see death before he had
seen the Christ of the Lord.”<a id="FNanchor_1268" href="#Footnote_1268" class="fnanchor">[1268]</a> But he did not receive
this grace except by means of Mary, for he did
not see the Saviour until he saw him in the arms of
Mary. Hence, whoever wishes to find Jesus, will not
find him except through Mary. Let us, then, go to this
divine mother if we wish to find Jesus; and let us
go with great confidence. Mary said to her servant
Prudentiana Zagnoni,<a id="FNanchor_1269" href="#Footnote_1269" class="fnanchor">[1269]</a> that every year, on this day of
the purification, a great mercy would be shown to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_471"></a>[471]</span>
some sinner. Who knows but one of us may to-day
be that favored sinner? If our sins are great, greater
is the power of Mary. The Son can deny nothing to
this mother, says St. Bernard.<a id="FNanchor_1270" href="#Footnote_1270" class="fnanchor">[1270]</a> If Jesus is offended
with us, Mary immediately appeases him. Plutarch
relates that Antipater wrote to Alexander the
Great a long letter of accusations against Olympias,
the mother of Alexander. Having read the letter, he
answered: “Does not Antipater know that one tear of
my mother is enough to cancel an endless number of
letters of accusation”?<a id="FNanchor_1271" href="#Footnote_1271" class="fnanchor">[1271]</a> Thus we may imagine Jesus
would also answer to the accusations which the devil
presents him against us when Mary is praying him for
us: Does not Lucifer know that one prayer of my
mother, in favor of a sinner, is enough to make
me forget all the accusations of offences committed
against me? The following example is a proof of
this.</p>

<h5>EXAMPLE.</h5>

<p>This example is not recorded in any book, but a
priest, a companion of mine, related it to me, as
having happened to himself. While this priest was
hearing confessions in a certain church (for sufficient
reasons he did not mention the place where this
occurred, although the penitent gave him leave to
publish the fact), a youth stood before him, who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_472"></a>[472]</span>
appeared to wish and not to wish to come to confession.
The Father, after looking at him several
times, at length called him, and asked him if he wished
to make his confession. He answered, yes; but as
he required a long time for it, the confessor took
him into a retired room. There the penitent began
by telling him that he was a foreigner, and
of noble birth, but he could not believe that it
was possible for God to pardon him after the life he
had led. Besides innumerable other sins he had
committed of impurity, homicide, &amp;c., he said, that
being entirely in despair of salvation, he had set about
committing sins, not so much for his own gratification,
as to defy God, and manifest the hatred he bore him.
He said, that among other things, he had with him
a crucifix, which he had beaten out of contempt.
He said that just before, on that very morning, he
had made a sacrilegious communion, and for what
object? That he might put under his feet the
consecrated wafer. And that, in fact, he had actually
received, and was about to put in execution his horrible
intention, but was prevented by the people who
observed him. He then consigned to the confessor
the consecrated host, wrapped in a paper, and told
him that as he was passing by that church he had a
great desire to enter. He could not resist this desire,
and had entered. That then he felt great remorse
of conscience, together with a certain confused
and irresolute desire to make his confession. For
this reason he had placed himself before the confessional,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_473"></a>[473]</span>
but while standing there he felt so confused
and timid, that he wished to go away, but it seemed
as if some one had retained him by force: “Until,”
he said, “you, Father, called me; and now I find
myself here; I find myself making my confession;
but I know not how to do it.” The Father then
asked him if he had practiced any act of devotion
during that time; meaning towards the most holy
Mary; for such sudden conversions only come
through the powerful hands of the Virgin. “None,
Father; what devotion could I offer,” answered the
youth, “when I believed myself lost?” “But try to
remember more carefully,” replied the Father. “Father,
nothing.” But accidentally putting his hand to
his breast, he remembered that he wore the Scapular
of the Seven Dolors of Mary: “Maria addolorata.”
“Ah, my son,” said the confessor to him, “do you
not see that our blessed Lady has bestowed this grace
upon you? And know,” he added, “that this church
is a church of our blessed Lady.” Hearing this, the
youth was moved to contrition, and began to weep.
He confessed his sins, and his compunction increased
to such a degree that, bursting into tears, he fell,
overcome with grief, as it seemed, at the feet of the
Father, who, having restored him by a cordial, finally
finished hearing his confession, and absolved him with
the greatest consolation, as he was entirely contrite
and resolved to amend his life. The Father sent
him back to his own country after having obtained
from him full liberty to preach and publish everywhere<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_474"></a>[474]</span>
the great mercy exercised by Mary towards
him.</p>

<h5>PRAYER.</h5>

<p>Oh holy mother of God and my mother Mary, didst
thou then feel so great care of my salvation that thou
didst even consent to offer up to death the object
dearest to thy heart, thy beloved Jesus? If thou,
then, hast so greatly desired to see me saved, it is just
that next to God I should place in thee all my hopes.
Oh blessed Virgin, I do indeed confide entirely in thee.
Oh, by the merit of this great sacrifice of the life of
thy Son which to-day thou hast offered to God, pray
him to have pity on my soul, for which this immaculate
Lamb did not refuse to die upon the cross.</p>

<p>To-day, oh my queen, I also, in imitation of thee,
wish to offer my poor heart to God; but I fear that
he will refuse it, seeing it thus filthy and loathsome.
But if thou wilt offer it to him, he will not refuse it.
All the offerings made him by thy most pure hands
he accepts and receives. To thee, then, oh Mary, I
present myself to-day, miserable as I am, and to thee
I give myself entirely. Offer me as thine to the eternal
Father and to Jesus, and pray him that through
the merits of his Son, and by thy favor, he may accept
me, and take me for his own. Ah, my sweetest
mother, for the love thou bearest this Son whom thou
hast sacrificed, aid me always, and do not abandon
me. Do not permit that I should one day lose,
through my sins, this my most loving Redeemer, to-day<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_475"></a>[475]</span>
offered by thee with so much anguish to die on
the cross. Say to him that I am thy servant; say to
him that in thee I have placed all my hope; say to
him, in a word, that thou dost wish for my salvation,
and he will certainly graciously hear thee. Amen.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" id="DISCOURSE_VII">DISCOURSE VII.<br>
<span class="smaller">ON THE ASSUMPTION OF MARY.</span></h4>

</div>

<p>On this day the Church proposes to us to celebrate
two solemn observances in honor of Mary: one, her
happy departure from this earth; the other, her glorious
assumption into heaven. In the present discourse
we shall speak of her departure from this earth, and
in the next of her assumption.</p>

<p>How precious was the death of Mary! 1st, On
account of the special graces which attended it; 2d,
On account of the manner of it.</p>

<p>Death being the punishment of sin, it would seem
that the divine mother, all holy and exempt from
every stain, should not be subject to death, nor
suffer the same misfortune as the children of Adam,
who are infected by the poison of sin. But God,
wishing Mary in all things to be like to Jesus, required,
as the Son had died, that the mother should
also die; and because he wished to give to the just
an example of the blessed death prepared for them,
he decreed that the Virgin should die, but by a sweet<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_476"></a>[476]</span>
and happy death. Hence we will enter upon the
consideration, how precious was the death of Mary.
1st. On account of the special graces by which it was
accompanied. 2d. On account of the manner in
which it took place.</p>

<p><i>Point First.</i>—Three things render death bitter,
namely, attachment to earth, remorse for sin, and the
uncertainty of salvation. But the death of Mary was
entirely free from any such causes of bitterness, and
was attended by many circumstances which rendered
it precious and joyful. She died as she had always
lived, entirely detached from all earthly things; she
died in the most perfect peace of conscience; she died
in the certainty of eternal glory.</p>

<p>And in the first place, there is no doubt that attachment
to the goods of earth renders the death of the
worldly bitter and miserable, as the Holy Spirit says:
“Oh, death, how bitter is the remembrance of thee
to a man that hath peace in his possessions!”<a id="FNanchor_1272" href="#Footnote_1272" class="fnanchor">[1272]</a> But
because the saints die detached from the things of the
world, their death is not bitter, but sweet, lovely, and
precious; or, as St. Bernard explains, it is worth being
purchased at any price. Blessed are the dead who
die in the Lord: “Beati mortui qui in Domino moriuntur.”<a id="FNanchor_1273" href="#Footnote_1273" class="fnanchor">[1273]</a>
Who are they that being dead, die? Precisely
those happy souls that pass into eternity, already
detached, and, as it were, dead to all affections for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_477"></a>[477]</span>
terrestrial things, having found in God alone their
every good; as St. Francis of Assisium, who exclaimed:
My God, and my all: “Deus meus et
omnia.” But what soul was ever more detached from
the things of the world, and more united to God, than
the beautiful soul of Mary? She was indeed entirely
detached from her parents, since at the age of three
years, when children are most dependent on their
parents, and have the greatest need of their assistance,
Mary with so great resolution left them, and
went to shut herself up in the temple to attend to
the things of God. She was detached from riches,
contented to live always poor, and supporting herself
with the labor of her hands. She was detached from
honors, loving an humble and abject life, although
queenly honor belonged to her, for she traced her
descent from the kings of Israel. The Virgin herself
revealed to St. Elizabeth, a Benedictine nun, that
when she was left in the temple by her parents, she
resolved in her heart to have no other father, and to
love no other good but God.</p>

<p>St. John saw Mary represented in that woman
clothed with the sun, who held the moon under her
feet. “And there appeared a great wonder in heaven;
a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under
her feet.”<a id="FNanchor_1274" href="#Footnote_1274" class="fnanchor">[1274]</a> Interpreters explain the moon to signify
the goods of this earth, that are uncertain, and change
as the moon does. All these goods Mary never had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_478"></a>[478]</span>
in her heart, but always despised them and kept them
under her feet; living in this world as a solitary turtle-dove
in a desert; placing her affection on no earthly
thing, so that it was said of her: The voice of the
turtle is heard in our land: “Vox turturis audita est
in terra nostra.”<a id="FNanchor_1275" href="#Footnote_1275" class="fnanchor">[1275]</a> And again, “Who is she that goeth
up by the desert?”<a id="FNanchor_1276" href="#Footnote_1276" class="fnanchor">[1276]</a> whence Rupert says: “Thou
hast gone up by the desert, that is, having a solitary
soul.”<a id="FNanchor_1277" href="#Footnote_1277" class="fnanchor">[1277]</a> Mary, then, having always lived entirely detached
from the things of earth, and only united to
God, not bitter, but very sweet and dear to her was
death, which united her more closely to God, by the
eternal bonds of paradise.</p>

<p>Secondly, peace of conscience renders the death of
the just precious. The sins committed in life are
those worms that the most torment and gnaw the
heart of poor dying sinners, who, about to be presented
at the divine tribunal, see themselves at that
moment surrounded by their sins, which terrify them,
and pursue them with cries, as St. Bernard says:
“We are thy works, we will not desert thee.”<a id="FNanchor_1278" href="#Footnote_1278" class="fnanchor">[1278]</a> Certainly
Mary could not be afflicted in death by any remorse
of conscience, for she was always holy, always
pure, and always free from every shade of actual and
original sin; hence it was said of her: Thou art all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_479"></a>[479]</span>
fair, oh my love, and there is not a spot in thee:
“Tota pulchra es, amica mea, et macula non est in
te.”<a id="FNanchor_1279" href="#Footnote_1279" class="fnanchor">[1279]</a> As soon as she had the use of reason, that is,
from the first moment of her immaculate conception
in the womb of St. Ann, from that time she began
with all her powers to love her God; and thus she
continued to do, ever advancing more in perfection
and love through her whole life. All her thoughts,
her desires, her affections, were wholly given to God;
not a word, not a motion, not a glance of the eye, not
a breath of hers that was not for God and for his
glory, never departing one step, nor separating herself
for one moment from the divine love. Ah! in
the happy hour of her death how did all the lovely
virtues which she practised during her life surround
her blessed bed! That faith so constant, that affectionate
confidence in God, that patience so strong in the
midst of sufferings, that humility in the midst of so
many privileges, that modesty, that meekness, that
compassion for souls, that zeal for the divine glory,
and above all, that perfect charity towards God, with
that entire uniformity to the divine will—all, in a
word, thronged around her, and consoling her, said:
We are thy works, we will not desert thee: “Opera
tua sumus, non te deseremus.” Oh Lady and
mother, we are all children of thy loving heart;
now that thou art leaving this miserable life, we will
not leave thee, we also will go to attend thee and
honor thee in paradise, where, by our means, thou<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_480"></a>[480]</span>
wilt be crowned queen of all men and of all the
angels.</p>

<p>In the third place, the certainty of eternal salvation
renders death sweet. Death is called a passage,
since through death we pass from this short life to life
eternal. And, as the dread is great of those who
die in doubt of their salvation, and who approach the
solemn moment with just fear of passing into an eternal
death, thus, on the other hand, very great is the
joy of the saints at the end of life, hoping with some
security to go and possess God in heaven. A nun of
the order of St. Theresa, when the physician announced
to her that death was near, was so full of
joy that she said to him: “And how does it happen,
sir, that you tell me this good news and ask no fee for
it?” St. Lawrence Justinian being at the point of
death, and seeing his friends weeping around him, said
to them: “Away, away with your tears, this is no
time for tears.”<a id="FNanchor_1280" href="#Footnote_1280" class="fnanchor">[1280]</a> Go elsewhere to weep; if you will
remain with me you must rejoice, as I rejoice, in seeing
the gate of paradise open to unite me with my
God. And thus, also, a St. Peter of Alcantara, a St.
Louis of Gonzaga, and so many other saints, on hearing
that death was at hand, burst forth into exclamations
of joy and gladness. And yet they were not
certain of the divine favor, nor secure of their own
sanctity, as Mary was secure of hers. But what joy
must the divine mother have felt in learning that her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_481"></a>[481]</span>
death was at hand; she, who had the fullest security
of enjoying the divine favor, especially after the angel
Gabriel had assured her that she was full of grace,
and already possessed God! “Hail, full of grace, the
Lord is with thee ... thou hast found grace.”<a id="FNanchor_1281" href="#Footnote_1281" class="fnanchor">[1281]</a> And
well did she herself know that her heart was burning
continually with divine love, so that as Bernardine de
Bustis says, Mary, by a singular grace not granted to
any other saint, loved, and was always actually occupied
in loving God every moment of her life, and so
ardently, that, as St. Bernard says, it required a perpetual
miracle to preserve her life in the midst of
such burning flames.</p>

<p>It was before said of Mary in the sacred Canticles:
“Who is she that goeth up by the desert as a pillar
of smoke of aromatical spices, of myrrh, and frankincense,
and of all the powders of the perfumer?”<a id="FNanchor_1282" href="#Footnote_1282" class="fnanchor">[1282]</a>
Her entire mortification was prefigured in the myrrh,
her fervent prayers were signified by the incense, and
all her holy virtues united to her perfect charity towards
God, kindled in her a flame so great, that
her holy soul, wholly devoted to, and consumed by
divine love, arose continually to God as a pillar of
smoke that on all sides breathed sweet odor. As a
pillar of smoke, oh blessed Lady, wrote Rupert, thou<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_482"></a>[482]</span>
hast breathed forth a sweet odor to the Most High.<a id="FNanchor_1283" href="#Footnote_1283" class="fnanchor">[1283]</a>
And Eustachius still more strongly expresses it: A pillar
of smoke, because burning interiorly as a holocaust
with the flame of divine love, she sent forth a most
sweet odor.<a id="FNanchor_1284" href="#Footnote_1284" class="fnanchor">[1284]</a> As the loving Virgin lived, such she
died. As divine love gave her life, so it gave her
death; for she died as the holy Doctors and Fathers
of the Church generally affirm, of no other infirmity
than pure love; for St. Ildephonsus says, that Mary
either ought not to die, or only die of love.</p>

<p><i>Second Point.</i>—But let us now see what were the
circumstances of her happy death. After the ascension
of Jesus Christ, Mary remained on earth to attend
to the propagation of the faith. Hence the disciples
of Jesus had recourse to her, and she resolved their
doubts, comforted them in their persecutions, and encouraged
them to labor for the divine glory and for
the salvation of the souls redeemed by her Son. She,
indeed, willingly remained on earth, understanding
this to be the will of God for the good of the Church;
but she could not but feel the pain of being far from
the presence and sight of her beloved Son, who had
ascended into heaven. “Where your treasure is,”
said the Redeemer, “there will your heart be also.”<a id="FNanchor_1285" href="#Footnote_1285" class="fnanchor">[1285]</a>
Where any one believes his treasure and his happiness<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_483"></a>[483]</span>
to lie, there he always holds the love and desire of his
heart fixed. If Mary then loved no other good than
Jesus, he being in heaven, in heaven were all her desires.
Taulerus wrote of Mary: The cell of Mary was
heaven: “Mariæ cella fuit cœlum,”<a id="FNanchor_1286" href="#Footnote_1286" class="fnanchor">[1286]</a> for being in
heaven with her affection, she made of it her continual
abode. Her school was eternity: “Schola æternitas,”
for she was always detached from temporal possessions.
Her teacher, divine truth: “Pædagogus divina
veritas,” for she was always guided in her actions
by the divine light. Her mirror, the Divinity: “Speculum
divinitas,” for she looked upon nothing but
God, in order to conform always to the divine will.
Her ornament, devotion: “Ornatus ejus devotio,”
for she was always ready to fulfil the divine commands.
Her repose, union with God: “Quies unitas
cum Deo,” for her peace was only in uniting herself
with God. In a word, the place and treasure
of her heart was God alone: “Cordis illius locus et
thesaurus solus Deus erat.” The most holy Virgin
consoled her loving heart during this cruel separation,
by visiting, as it is narrated, the holy places of Palestine,
where her Son had been in his lifetime: she often
visited now the stable of Bethlehem, where her Son
was born; now the workshop at Nazareth, where her
Son had lived so many years poor and despised; now
the garden of Gethsemane, where her Son commenced
his passion; now the hall of Pilate, where he was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_484"></a>[484]</span>
scourged; the place where he was crowned; but
more often she visited Calvary, where her Son had
expired; and the holy sepulchre, where she finally had
left him. And thus the most loving mother used to
soothe the pains of her cruel exile. But this was
not enough to satisfy her heart, which could not find
its perfect rest upon this earth; hence her continual
sighs were ascending to her Lord, as she exclaimed
with David, but with more ardent love: “Who will
give me wings like a dove, and I will fly and be at
rest.”<a id="FNanchor_1287" href="#Footnote_1287" class="fnanchor">[1287]</a> Who will give me wings like a dove to fly to
my God and there to find my rest? “As the hart
panteth after the fountains of water, so my soul panteth
after thee, oh God.”<a id="FNanchor_1288" href="#Footnote_1288" class="fnanchor">[1288]</a> As the wounded stag
pants for the fountain, so my soul, wounded by thy
love, oh my God, desires and sighs for thee. Ah, the
sighs of this holy turtle-dove could not but reach the
heart of her God, who loved her so much: “The
voice of the turtle is heard in our land.” Wherefore
not being willing to defer any longer consolation to
his beloved, behold, he graciously hears her desire
and calls her to his kingdom.</p>

<p>Cedrenus,<a id="FNanchor_1289" href="#Footnote_1289" class="fnanchor">[1289]</a> Nicephorus,<a id="FNanchor_1290" href="#Footnote_1290" class="fnanchor">[1290]</a>
    and Metaphrastes,<a id="FNanchor_1291" href="#Footnote_1291" class="fnanchor">[1291]</a> relate,
that the Lord, some days before her death, sent to her
the angel Gabriel, the same who once announced to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_485"></a>[485]</span>
her that she was the blessed woman chosen to be the
mother of God: My Lady and Queen, said the angel
to her, God has already graciously heard thy
holy desires, and he has sent me to tell thee to prepare
to leave the earth, for he wishes thee with him
in paradise. Come then, to take possession of thy
kingdom, for I and all its holy citizens await and desire
thee. At this happy annunciation what should
our most humble and holy Virgin do but conceal herself
more deeply in the centre of her most profound
humility, and reply in those same words with which
she answered St. Gabriel when he announced to her
that she was to become mother of God: Behold the
handmaid of the Lord: “Ecce ancilla Domini?”
Behold, she again answered, the servant of the Lord;
he in his pure goodness has chosen me and made me
his mother; now he calls me to paradise. I neither
merited the one nor the other honor; but since he
wishes to manifest his infinite liberality towards me, I
am ready to go where he wishes. “Behold the handmaid
of the Lord;” may the will of my God and Lord
always be fulfilled in me.</p>

<p>After receiving this precious intelligence, she imparted
it to St. John, and we may imagine with what
grief and tender emotion he heard this news; he who
for so many years had been near her as a son, and had
enjoyed the celestial conversation of this most holy
mother. She then visited anew the holy places of
Jerusalem, tenderly taking leave of them, especially
of Calvary, where her beloved Son had died. And<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_486"></a>[486]</span>
then she returned to her poor dwelling to prepare for
death. During this time the angels did not cease to
come and visit this their beloved queen, consoling
themselves with the thought that they should soon see
her crowned in heaven. Many authors assert,<a id="FNanchor_1292" href="#Footnote_1292" class="fnanchor">[1292]</a> that
before she died, by a divine miracle, the apostles and
also some of the disciples came from the different
places where they were dispersed, and all assembled in
the apartment of Mary, and that when she saw all these
her dear children united together in her presence, she
thus addressed them: My dear children, for love of
you, and to help you, my Son left me on this earth.
But now the holy faith is spread throughout the
world, already the fruit of the divine seed is grown
up; hence my divine Son, seeing that my assistance
was no longer needed upon the earth, and compassionating
me for the pain of separation, has graciously
heard my desire to depart from this life, and go to
see him in glory. If I leave you, my heart does not
leave you; I will carry with me the great love I bear
you, and it shall always remain with me. I am going
to paradise to pray for you. At these sad tidings,
who can realize how great were the tears and lamentations
of these holy disciples, knowing that they
were shortly to be separated from their mother?
Then, they all in tears exclaimed, then, oh Mary,
thou wilt leave us! It is true that this earth is not
a worthy and fit place for thee, and that we are not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_487"></a>[487]</span>
worthy to enjoy the society of a mother of God; but
remember that thou art our mother; thou hast until
now enlightened us in our doubts, consoled our sorrows,
strengthened us in persecutions, and how canst
thou now abandon us, leaving us alone without thy
comfort in the midst of so many enemies and so many
conflicts? We have already lost on earth Jesus, our
Master and our Father, who has ascended into heaven;
we have since been consoled by thee, our mother; and
now how canst thou leave us orphans, without father
or mother? Oh remain with us, oh our Lady! or
take us with thee. Thus writes St. John Damascene.<a id="FNanchor_1293" href="#Footnote_1293" class="fnanchor">[1293]</a>
“No, my children (thus sweetly the loving queen
began to speak) this is not according to the will of
God; content yourselves to do what he has appointed
for you and for me. To you it yet remains to labor
on the earth for the glory of your Redeemer, and to
perfect your eternal crown. I do not leave you to
abandon you, but to help you more by my intercession
with God in heaven. Be satisfied. I commend
to you the holy Church; I commend to you the souls
redeemed by my Son; let this be my last farewell,
and the only remembrance that I leave you. If you
love me, labor for souls, and for the glory of my Son;
for we shall one day meet again in paradise, never
more to separate throughout eternity.”</p>

<p>Then she begged them to give burial to her body
after death, blessed them, and directed St. John, as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_488"></a>[488]</span>
Damascene relates,<a id="FNanchor_1294" href="#Footnote_1294" class="fnanchor">[1294]</a> that after her death he should
give her two garments to two virgins who had served
her for some time, and then she decently composed
herself upon her poor little bed, where she laid
herself to await death, and with death the meeting
with her divine spouse, who shortly was to come
and take her with him to the kingdom of the
blessed. Behold, she already feels in her heart a great
joy, the forerunner of the coming of the spouse,
which overwhelms her with a great and new sweetness.
The holy apostles, seeing that Mary already
was about to depart from this earth, burst forth into
fresh weeping, and knelt around her bed: some kissed
her holy feet, others asked her special blessing, one
recommended to her some particular necessity of his,
and all wept bitterly, for their hearts were pierced
with grief at being obliged to separate forever in this
life from their beloved Lady. And she, their most
loving mother, compassionated all, consoled all, promising
to some her protection, blessing others with peculiar
affection, and encouraging others to labor for
the conversion of the world; especially did she call
St. Peter to her, and as head of the Church, and
vicar of her Son, she recommended to him in particular
the propagation of the faith, promising him her
special protection from heaven. But in a very special
manner did she call to her St. John, who felt a greater
sorrow than all the others at the moment of separation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_489"></a>[489]</span>
from that holy mother; and the most grateful
Lady, calling to mind the affection and attention with
which this holy disciple had served her through all
the years they had passed on earth since the death
of her Son, said to him with great tenderness: My
John, I thank thee for all the assistance thou hast
afforded me; my son, be certain that I never will be
ungrateful to thee for it. If I leave thee now, I am
going to pray for thee. Remain in peace in this life
until we meet in heaven, where I will await thee.
Do not forget me; in all thy necessities call me to thy
aid, for I never will forget thee, my beloved son. My
son, I bless thee, I leave thee my benediction; rest in
peace—adieu.</p>

<p>But the death of Mary draws near. The divine
love, with its blessed and ardent flames, having almost
entirely consumed the vital spirits, the celestial phœnix
is going to lose her life in the midst of this fire.
Then the hosts of angels come to meet her, as if to be
ready for the great triumph with which they were to
accompany her to paradise. Mary was indeed consoled
at the sight of these holy spirits; but not fully
consoled, for she did not yet see her beloved Jesus,
who was the whole love of her heart. Hence she
often repeated to the angels who descended to salute
her: “I adjure you, oh daughters of Jerusalem, if
you find my beloved, that you tell him that I languish
with love.”<a id="FNanchor_1295" href="#Footnote_1295" class="fnanchor">[1295]</a> Oh holy angels! oh blessed citizens of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_490"></a>[490]</span>
the heavenly Jerusalem! ye come in hosts kindly to
console me, and ye all console me with your sweet
presence; I thank you, but ye all do not fully satisfy
me, for I do not yet see my Son coming to console
me. Go, if you love me, return to paradise, and tell
my beloved, from me, that I languish and faint for his
love. Tell him to come, and come quickly, for I am
dying with my desire to see him.</p>

<p>But behold, Jesus himself comes to take his mother
to the kingdom of the blessed. It was revealed to
St. Elizabeth, that the Son appeared to Mary before
she expired, with the cross in his hand, to show the
special glory he had obtained from the redemption,
having by his death made the acquisition of this great
creature, who through the ages of eternity was to
honor him more than all men and all angels. St. John
of Damascus relates, that he gave to her the viaticum,
saying to her, tenderly: Take, oh my mother, from
my hands, that same body which thou hast given me.
And the mother having received with the greatest love
that final communion, with her last sighs said to him:
My Son, into thy hands I commend my spirit; I
recommend to thee this soul that thou, in thy goodness,
didst create even from the beginning, rich in so
many graces, and by a peculiar privilege hast preserved
from every stain of sin. I commend to thee my body,
from which thou hast deigned to take flesh and blood.
I commend to thee, also, these my dear children
(speaking of the holy disciples who were around her);
they are afflicted at my departure; do thou console<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_491"></a>[491]</span>
them, who lovest them more than I do; bless them,
and give them strength to do great things for thy
glory.<a id="FNanchor_1296" href="#Footnote_1296" class="fnanchor">[1296]</a></p>

<p>The end of the life of Mary having now arrived,
there was heard, as St. Jerome relates, in the apartment
where she lay, a great harmony; and also, as it
was revealed to St. Bridget, a great brightness was
seen. By this harmony and unusual splendor the
holy Apostles perceived that Mary was then departing,
at which they broke forth again in tears and
prayers, and raising their hands, with one voice exclaimed:
Oh, our mother, now thou art going to
heaven, and art leaving us, give us thy last benediction,
and do not forget us in our misery. And Mary,
turning her eyes around upon them all, as if bidding
them for the last time farewell, said: Adieu, my
children: I bless you; do not fear that I shall forget
you. And now death came, not indeed clothed with
mourning and sadness, as it comes to others, but
adorned with light and joy. But why death, why
death? Rather should we say that divine love came
to cut the thread of that noble life. And as a lamp
before going out, her life, amid these last flickerings,
flashed forth more brightly, and then expired. Thus,
this beautiful soul, her Son inviting her to follow
him, wrapped in the flame of her charity, and in
the midst of her amorous sighs, breathed forth a
greater sigh of love, expired and died; and thus that
great soul, that beautiful dove of our Lord, was released<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_492"></a>[492]</span>
from the bonds of this life, and entered into the
glory of the blessed, where she sits, and will sit, as
queen of paradise, for all eternity.</p>

<p>Now Mary has left the earth, now she is in heaven.
From thence this kind mother looks down upon us,
who are still in this valley of tears, compassionates us,
and promises us her support if we wish for it. Let
us pray her always that by the merits of her blessed
death she may obtain for us a happy death; and if it
please God, that she may obtain for us to die on a
Saturday, which is dedicated to her honor, or on a
day of the Novena, or of the octave of some of her
feasts, as she has obtained for so many of her servants,
and especially for St. Stanislas Kostka, for
whom she obtained to die on the day of her glorious
Assumption, as Father Bartoli relates in his life of the
saint.<a id="FNanchor_1297" href="#Footnote_1297" class="fnanchor">[1297]</a></p>

<h5>EXAMPLE.</h5>

<p>During the lifetime of this holy youth, who was
wholly devoted to the love of Mary, it happened that
on the first day of August, he heard a sermon of
Father Peter Canisius, in which, preaching to the
novices of his society, he fervently urged upon all, the
important advice, to live every day as if it might be
the last of their life, after which they were to be presented
at the divine tribunal. The sermon being finished,
St. Stanislas told his companions that this counsel
had been for him especially the voice of God, for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_493"></a>[493]</span>
that he was to die on that very month. He said this
either because God had expressly revealed it to him,
or at least because he gave him a certain internal presentiment
of what afterwards happened. Four days
after, the blessed youth went with Father Emmanuel
to St. Mary Major, and beginning to speak of the approaching
festival of the Assumption, he said: “Father,
I believe that on that day there is seen in paradise a
new paradise, the glory being seen there of the mother
of God crowned queen of heaven, and seated so
near the Lord above all the choirs of angels. And if
it is true that every year, as I believe it to be certain,
this festival is renewed in heaven, I hope to see the
next one.” The glorious martyr St. Lawrence, having
fallen to the saint by lot as his monthly patron, according
to the custom of that society, it is said that he
wrote a letter to his mother Mary, in which he prayed
her to obtain for him that he might be a spectator of
this festival of hers in paradise. On St. Lawrence’s day
he received communion, and after it supplicated the
saint to present that letter to the divine mother, by
interposing his intercession that the most holy Mary
might graciously hear his prayer. At the close of this
very day a fever came upon him, and although it was
very light, he, however, from that hour esteemed it for
certain that he had obtained the favor asked for him,
namely, an early death. Indeed, on going to bed he
said joyfully, with a smiling countenance: “From this
bed I shall never arise.” And speaking to Father
Claudius Aquaviva, he added: “I believe that St.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_494"></a>[494]</span>
Lawrence has already obtained for me the grace from
Mary that I should be in heaven on the festival of her
Assumption.” But no one thought much of these his
words. The vigil having arrived, his malady continued
to appear light, but the saint told a brother
that he should die the next night, and the brother
answered: “Oh, brother, it would be a greater miracle
to die of so slight an illness, than to be cured.”
But, behold, after noon he fell into a deadly swoon,
and then came a cold sweat, and he entirely lost his
strength. The superior hastened to him, and Stanislas
prayed him to order him to be placed on the bare
floor, that he might die as a penitent, which was granted
in order to satisfy him, and he was laid on the floor on
a mattress. Then he made his confession, received
the viaticum, not without the tears of all present, for
when the divine sacrament was brought into the apartment,
his eyes kindled with celestial joy, and his
whole countenance was radiant with holy love, so
that he seemed a seraph. He also received extreme
unction, and meanwhile did nothing but now raise his
eyes to heaven, now look upon, kiss, and lovingly
press to his breast, an image of Mary. A father said
to him: “Of what use is it to wear that rosary
around your hand, if you cannot recite it?” He
answered: “It serves to console me, for it is something
belonging to my mother.” “Oh, how much more,”
said the Father, “will you be consoled by seeing her,
and kissing, in a short time, her hands in heaven!”
Then the saint, with his countenance all on fire, raised<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_495"></a>[495]</span>
his hands, thus to express his desire of finding himself
soon in her presence. Then his dear mother appeared
to him, as he himself declared to those around him,
and soon after, at the dawn of day on the fifteenth of
August, he expired as a saint, his eyes fixed on heaven,
without a motion, so that not until afterwards, when
the image of the most holy Virgin was presented, and
he made no movement towards it, it was perceived
that he had already gone to kiss in paradise the feet
of his beloved queen.</p>

<h5>PRAYER.</h5>

<p>Oh, our most sweet Lady and Mother, thou hast
already left the earth, and hast reached thy kingdom,
where thou sittest as queen over all the choirs of
angels, as the holy Church sings: She was exalted
above the choirs of angels in the celestial kingdoms:
“Exaltata est super choros angelorum ad cœlestia
regna.” We know that we sinners are not worthy
of having thee with us in this valley of darkness.
But we know also, that thou in thy grandeur hast
never forgotten us in our misery, and by being exalted
to such glory hast never lost compassion for us poor
children of Adam, but rather that it is increased in thee.
From the high throne then, where thou dost reign,
turn, oh Mary, even upon us, thy pitying eyes, and
take compassion upon us. Remember, too, that on
leaving this world, thou didst promise not to forget
us. Look upon us and succor us. See in what tempests
and in how many dangers we are, and always<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_496"></a>[496]</span>
shall be, till the end of our life arrives. By the merits
of thy holy death, obtain for us holy perseverance in
the divine friendship, that we may finally depart from
this life in the grace of God, and thus come one day
to kiss thy feet in paradise, and unite ourselves with
the blessed spirits in praising thee, and singing thy
glories, as thou dost merit. Amen.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" id="DISCOURSE_VIII">DISCOURSE VIII.<br>
<span class="smaller">ANOTHER DISCOURSE ON THE ASSUMPTION OF MARY.</span></h4>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>1st. How glorious was the triumph of Mary when she ascended
to heaven! 2d. How exalted was the throne to which she
was raised in heaven!</i></p>

</div>

<p>It would seem just that the holy Church, on this
day of the Assumption of Mary to heaven, should
rather invite us to weep than to rejoice, since our sweet
mother has quitted this earth, and left us bereft of her
sweet presence, as St. Bernard says: It seems that we
should rather weep than exult: “Plangendum nobis,
quam plaudendum magis esse videtur.”<a id="FNanchor_1298" href="#Footnote_1298" class="fnanchor">[1298]</a> But no, the
holy Church invites us to rejoice: “Let us all rejoice
in the Lord, celebrating a festival in honor of the
blessed Virgin Mary.”<a id="FNanchor_1299" href="#Footnote_1299" class="fnanchor">[1299]</a> And justly, if we love this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_497"></a>[497]</span>
our mother, we ought to congratulate ourselves more
upon her glory than upon our own particular consolation.
What son does not rejoice, although separated
from his mother, if he knows that she is going to take
possession of a kingdom? Mary, to-day, is to be
crowned queen of heaven, and shall we not make a
feast and rejoice if we truly love her? Let us all rejoice,
let us rejoice: “Gaudeamus omnes, et gaudeamus.”
And that we may be consoled the more by
her exaltation, let us consider, in the first place, how
glorious was the triumph of Mary ascending to heaven;
secondly, how exalted was the throne to which she was
elevated in heaven.</p>

<p><i>First Point.</i>—After Jesus Christ our Saviour had
completed the work of our redemption by his death,
the angels earnestly desired to have him with them in
their heavenly country; hence they were continually
supplicating him, repeating the words of David:
“Arise, oh Lord, into thy resting-place, thou and the
ark which thou hast sanctified.”<a id="FNanchor_1300" href="#Footnote_1300" class="fnanchor">[1300]</a> Come, oh Lord,
now that thou hast redeemed men, come to thy kingdom
with us, and bring with thee also the living ark
of thy sanctification, namely, thy mother, who was
the ark sanctified by thee when thou didst inhabit
her womb. Thus St. Bernardine puts it into the
mouth of the angels to say: Let thy most holy
mother Mary also ascend, sanctified by thy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_498"></a>[498]</span>
conception.<a id="FNanchor_1301" href="#Footnote_1301" class="fnanchor">[1301]</a> At length, then, our Lord wished to satisfy
this desire of those citizens of the heavenly country,
by calling Mary to paradise. But, if he wished that
the ark of the covenant should be conducted with
great pomp into the city of David—And David and
all the house of Israel brought the ark of the covenant
of the Lord with joyful shouting, and with sound
of trumpet<a id="FNanchor_1302" href="#Footnote_1302" class="fnanchor">[1302]</a>—with far more splendid and glorious
pomp he ordained that his mother should enter
into heaven. The prophet Elias was carried up to
heaven in a chariot of fire, which, according to the
interpreters, was but a company of angels who raised
him from the earth. But to conduct thee into heaven,
oh mother of God, as Rupert the Abbot says, a company
of angels was not enough, but the King of
heaven himself, with all his celestial court, came to
accompany thee.<a id="FNanchor_1303" href="#Footnote_1303" class="fnanchor">[1303]</a></p>

<p>St. Bernardine of Sienna is of the same opinion,
namely: that Jesus Christ, in order to honor the
triumph of Mary, came himself from paradise to
meet and accompany her.<a id="FNanchor_1304" href="#Footnote_1304" class="fnanchor">[1304]</a> And precisely for this
object it was, says St. Anselm, that the Redeemer
wished to ascend before his mother, not only to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_499"></a>[499]</span>
prepare for her a throne in that palace, but also to
render her entrance into heaven more glorious, by accompanying
her himself, with all the blessed spirits.<a id="FNanchor_1305" href="#Footnote_1305" class="fnanchor">[1305]</a>
Hence St. Peter Damian, contemplating the
splendor of this assumption of Mary into heaven,
says that we shall find it more glorious than the
ascension of Jesus Christ; for the angels only came
to meet the Redeemer, but the blessed Virgin went
to glory met and accompanied by the Lord of glory
himself, and by all the blessed company of saints
and angels.<a id="FNanchor_1306" href="#Footnote_1306" class="fnanchor">[1306]</a> Hence Guerric the Abbot represents
the divine Word speaking thus: I descended from
heaven upon earth to give glory to my Father; but
afterwards, to pay honor to my mother, I ascended
again into heaven, that I might thus be enabled to
come to meet her, and accompany her by my presence
to paradise.<a id="FNanchor_1307" href="#Footnote_1307" class="fnanchor">[1307]</a></p>

<p>Let us now consider how the Saviour really did
come from heaven to meet his mother, and at the
first interview said, to console her: “Arise, make<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_500"></a>[500]</span>
haste, my love, my dove, my beautiful one, and
come; for winter is now past ... and gone.”<a id="FNanchor_1308" href="#Footnote_1308" class="fnanchor">[1308]</a> Come,
my dear mother, my beautiful and pure dove, leave
that valley of tears where thou hast suffered so much
for my love; come from Libanus, my spouse, come
from Libanus, come, thou shalt be crowned.<a id="FNanchor_1309" href="#Footnote_1309" class="fnanchor">[1309]</a> Come
with soul and body, to enjoy the reward of thy holy
life. If thou hast suffered much upon earth, far
greater is the glory that I have prepared for thee in
heaven. Come there to sit near me; come to receive
the crown that I will give thee as queen of the universe.
Now, behold, Mary leaves the earth, and
calling to mind the many graces she had there received
from her Lord, she looks at it at the same time
both with affection and compassion, leaving in it so
many poor children, in the midst of so many miseries
and dangers. And now Jesus offers her his hand,
and the blessed mother rises in the air and passes beyond
the clouds and spheres. Behold her now arrived
at the gates of heaven. When monarchs make
their entrance to take possession of their kingdom, they
do not pass through the gates of the city, for either
these are taken off entirely, or they pass over them.
Hence the angels, when Jesus Christ entered paradise,
cried: “Lift up your gates, O ye princes, and be ye
lifted up, O eternal gates; and the King of glory<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_501"></a>[501]</span>
shall enter in.”<a id="FNanchor_1310" href="#Footnote_1310" class="fnanchor">[1310]</a> Thus, also, now that Mary is going
to take possession of the kingdom of the heavens, the
angels who accompany her cry to the others who are
within: “Lift up your gates, ye princes, and be ye
lifted up, O eternal gates, and the queen of glory
shall enter in.”<a id="FNanchor_1311" href="#Footnote_1311" class="fnanchor">[1311]</a></p>

<p>And now Mary enters into the blessed country.
But on her entrance, the celestial spirits seeing her so
beautiful and glorious, ask of those who are without, as
Origen describes it, and exclaim, all rejoicing in heaven
in one (voice): “Who is this that cometh up from
the desert, flowing with delights, leaning upon her
beloved?”<a id="FNanchor_1312" href="#Footnote_1312" class="fnanchor">[1312]</a> And who is this creature so beautiful,
that comes from the desert of the earth, a place full
of thorns and tribulation? But this one comes so
pure and so rich in virtue, supported by her beloved
Lord, who deigns to accompany her with so great honor.
Who is she? The angels who accompany her answer:
This is the mother of our King, she is our queen,
and the blessed one among women, full of grace, the
saint of saints, the beloved of God, the immaculate,
the dove, the most beautiful of all creatures. And
then all those blessed spirits begin to bless and praise
her, singing, with more reason than the Hebrews said<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_502"></a>[502]</span>
to Judith: “Thou art the glory of Jerusalem, thou
art the joy of Israel, thou art the honor of our people.”<a id="FNanchor_1313" href="#Footnote_1313" class="fnanchor">[1313]</a>
Ah! our Lady and our queen, then thou art
the glory of paradise, the joy of our country, thou
art the honor of us all; be ever welcome, be ever
blessed; behold thy kingdom, behold us, we are all
thy servants, ready for thy commands.</p>

<p>Then all the saints who were at that time in paradise
came to welcome her and salute her as their
queen. All the holy virgins came: They saw her,
and declared her most blessed ... and they praised
her.<a id="FNanchor_1314" href="#Footnote_1314" class="fnanchor">[1314]</a> We, they said, oh most blessed Lady, are also
queens of this kingdom, but thou art our queen; for
thou wast the first to give us the great example of
consecrating our virginity to God; we all bless and
thank thee for it. Then came the holy confessors to
salute her as their mistress, who had taught them so
many beautiful virtues by her holy life. The holy
martyrs came also to salute her as their queen, because
by her great constancy in the sorrows of the
passion of her Son, she had taught them, and also
obtained for them by her merits, strength to give
their life for the faith. St. James came also, the only
one of the apostles who was then in paradise, to thank
her in the name of all the other apostles, for the great
comfort and support she had given them while she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_503"></a>[503]</span>
was upon earth. The prophets next came to salute
her, and they said to her: Ah, Lady, thou wast foreshadowed
in our prophecies. The holy patriarchs
came and said to her: Oh Mary, thou hast been our
hope, so much and so long sighed for by us. And
among those came our first parents, Adam and Eve, to
thank her with greater affection. Ah, beloved daughter,
they said to her, thou hast repaired the injury done by
us to the human race; thou hast obtained for the
world that blessing lost by us, on account of our crime;
by thee we are saved, and for it be forever blessed.</p>

<p>Then came holy Simeon to kiss her feet, and with
joy reminded her of that day on which he received
from her hands the infant Jesus. St. Zachary and
St. Elizabeth also came, and thanked her again for
that loving visit, that with so much humility and
charity she made them in their dwelling, and through
which they received so many treasures of grace. St.
John the Baptist came with greater affection to thank
her for having sanctified him by means of her voice.
But what could her parents, St. Joachim and St.
Anna, say to her, when they came to salute her?
Oh God! with what tenderness must they have
blessed her, saying: Ah! beloved daughter, what
happiness was ours in having such a child! Ah! be
thou our queen now, because thou art the mother of our
God; as such we salute thee and adore thee. But
who can comprehend the affection with which her
dear spouse St. Joseph came to salute her? Who
can describe the joy that the holy patriarch experienced<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_504"></a>[504]</span>
at seeing his spouse arrive in heaven with so
much triumph, made queen of all paradise? With
what tenderness did he say to her: Ah! my Lady
and spouse, how shall I ever be able to thank our
God as I ought for having made me thy spouse, thou
who art his true mother? Through thee I merited
on earth to attend upon the childhood of the incarnate
Word, to bear him so often in my arms, and receive
from him so many special favors. Blessed be the
moments that I spent in life serving Jesus and thee,
my holy spouse. Behold our Jesus; let us console
ourselves that now he is no more lying in a stable
upon hay, as we saw him at his birth in Bethlehem;
he does not now live poor and despised in a shop, as
once he lived with us in Nazareth; he is not now
nailed to a shameful cross, as when he died for the
salvation of the world in Jerusalem; but he sits at the
right hand of the Father, as king and Lord of heaven
and of earth. And now, oh my queen, we shall never
more depart from his holy feet, where we shall bless
and love him eternally.</p>

<p>Then all the angels came to salute her, and she, the
great queen, thanked all for the assistance they had
given her on earth, especially thanking the Archangel
St. Gabriel, who was the happy ambassador of all her
glories, when he came to announce to her that she
was to be made mother of God. Then the humble
and holy Virgin, kneeling, adores the divine majesty,
and, wholly lost in the consciousness of her nothingness,
thanks him for all the graces bestowed upon her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_505"></a>[505]</span>
solely by his goodness, and especially for having made
her mother of the eternal Word. Let those who can,
comprehend with what love the most holy Trinity
blessed her. Let them comprehend what a welcome
the eternal Father gave to his daughter, the Son to
his mother, the Holy Spirit to his spouse. The Father
crowns her by sharing with her his power, the Son
his wisdom, the Holy Spirit his love. And all the
three divine persons establishing her throne at the
right hand of Jesus, declare her universal queen of
heaven and of earth, and command angels and all
creatures to recognize her for their queen, and as
queen to serve and obey her. And here we pass on
to the consideration of how exalted was this throne to
which Mary was elevated in heaven.</p>

<p><i>Second Point.</i>—If the human mind, says St. Bernard,
cannot attain to comprehend the immense glory
which God has prepared in heaven for those who have
loved him on earth, as the apostle declares, who will
ever attain to comprehend what he has prepared for
her who bore him? “Quid præparavit gignenti se”?
What glory did he prepare for his beloved mother, he
who on earth loved her more than all men; who, even
from the first moment of her creation, loved her more
than all men and angels united! Justly, then, does
the holy Church sing that Mary having loved God
more than all the angels, she has been exalted above
all the angels in heaven.<a id="FNanchor_1315" href="#Footnote_1315" class="fnanchor">[1315]</a> Yes, she was exalted, says<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_506"></a>[506]</span>
William the Abbot, above the angels, so that she sees
no one above her but her Son, who is the only begotten
Son of God.<a id="FNanchor_1316" href="#Footnote_1316" class="fnanchor">[1316]</a></p>

<p>Hence the learned Gerson asserts, that all the orders
of angels and of saints being divided into three
hierarchies, as the angelic Doctor declares,<a id="FNanchor_1317" href="#Footnote_1317" class="fnanchor">[1317]</a> and St.
Dionysius also, Mary constitutes in heaven a hierarchy
of herself, the most sublime of all, and next to God.<a id="FNanchor_1318" href="#Footnote_1318" class="fnanchor">[1318]</a>
And as the mistress, St. Antoninus adds, is incomparably
above her servants, so is the glory of Mary
incomparably greater than that of the angels.<a id="FNanchor_1319" href="#Footnote_1319" class="fnanchor">[1319]</a> And
in order to understand this, it is enough to know what
David said, that this queen was seated at the right
hand of the Son: The queen stood on thy right hand:
“Astitit regina a dextris tuis.”<a id="FNanchor_1320" href="#Footnote_1320" class="fnanchor">[1320]</a> Which St. Athanasius
exactly explained by saying: Mary is placed at
the right hand of God.<a id="FNanchor_1321" href="#Footnote_1321" class="fnanchor">[1321]</a></p>

<p>The works of Mary, as St. Ildephonsus says, certainly
incomparably surpassed in merit the works of
all the saints, and therefore the reward and the glory
she merited cannot be conceived.<a id="FNanchor_1322" href="#Footnote_1322" class="fnanchor">[1322]</a> And if it is certain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_507"></a>[507]</span>
that God rewards according to merit, as the apostle
says, “Who will render to every man according to
his works;”<a id="FNanchor_1323" href="#Footnote_1323" class="fnanchor">[1323]</a> it is also certain, says St. Thomas, that
the Virgin, who excelled in merit all, both men and
angels, must have been exalted above all the celestial
orders.<a id="FNanchor_1324" href="#Footnote_1324" class="fnanchor">[1324]</a> In fine, adds St. Bernard, let us measure
the singular grace that she acquired on earth, and
then we may measure the singular glory that she has
obtained in heaven.<a id="FNanchor_1325" href="#Footnote_1325" class="fnanchor">[1325]</a></p>

<p>The glory of Mary, remarks a learned author,<a id="FNanchor_1326" href="#Footnote_1326" class="fnanchor">[1326]</a> which
was a full glory, a complete glory, is different from
that which the other saints have in heaven. It is true
that in heaven all the blessed enjoy a perfect peace
and full content; yet it will always be true that no
one of them enjoys that glory that he could have merited
if he had loved and served God with greater
fidelity. Hence, although the saints in heaven desire
nothing more than what they possess, yet, in fact,
there is something they could yet desire. It is also
true that the sins which they have committed, and the
time which they have lost, do not bring suffering; but
it cannot be denied that the most good done in life, innocence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_508"></a>[508]</span>
preserved and time well employed, give the
greatest content. Mary in heaven desires nothing, and
has nothing to desire. Who of the saints in paradise,
says St. Augustine, if asked whether he has committed
sins, can answer no, except Mary?<a id="FNanchor_1327" href="#Footnote_1327" class="fnanchor">[1327]</a> It is certain, as the
holy Council of Trent has defined,<a id="FNanchor_1328" href="#Footnote_1328" class="fnanchor">[1328]</a> that Mary never
committed any sin, not even the least; not only she has
never lost divine grace—never bedimmed it, but she
has never kept it unemployed; she never did an action
that was not meritorious; she never said a word, or
had a thought, or drew a breath, that was not directed
to the greatest glory of God; in a word, she never relaxed
or stopped one moment in her onward course to
God; she never lost any thing through negligence, for
she always corresponded with grace with all her power,
and loved God as much as she could love him. Oh
Lord, she now says to him in heaven, if I have not
loved thee as much as thou dost merit, at least I have
loved thee as much as I could.</p>

<p>The graces of the saints were different in each, as
St. Paul said: There are diversities of graces: “Divisiones
gratiarum sunt.” So that each of them corresponding
with the grace received, has rendered himself
excellent in some virtue; one in saving souls, one in
leading a life of penance, one in suffering torments,
one in contemplation; hence the holy Church, when
celebrating their festivals, says of each: And there
was not found the like to him: “Non est inventus<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_509"></a>[509]</span>
similis illi.” And as in their merits, so are they in
heaven different in glory: For star differeth from
star in glory: “Stella enim a stella differt.”<a id="FNanchor_1329" href="#Footnote_1329" class="fnanchor">[1329]</a> The
Apostles differ from the martyrs, confessors from virgins,
the innocents from penitents. The holy Virgin
being full of all graces, excelled each saint in every
kind of virtue; she was the apostle of the apostles;
she was queen of the martyrs, for she suffered more
than all of them; she was the standard-bearer of the
virgins, the model of spouses; she united in herself a
perfect innocence with a perfect mortification; in a
word, she united in her heart all the most heroic virtues
which any saint has ever practised. Hence it
was said of her: “The queen stood on thy right
hand in gilded clothing, surrounded with variety;”<a id="FNanchor_1330" href="#Footnote_1330" class="fnanchor">[1330]</a>
for all the graces, privileges, and merits of the other
saints were found united in Mary, as the Abbot of
Celles says: The prerogatives of all the saints, oh
Virgin, thou hast united in thyself.<a id="FNanchor_1331" href="#Footnote_1331" class="fnanchor">[1331]</a></p>

<p>Thus as the splendor of the sun exceeds the splendor
of all the stars united, so, says St. Basil, the glory
of the divine mother exceeds that of all the blessed.<a id="FNanchor_1332" href="#Footnote_1332" class="fnanchor">[1332]</a>
And St. Peter Damian adds, that as the light of the
stars and of the moon disappears as if they were not,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_510"></a>[510]</span>
at the rising of the sun, thus Mary so far obscures in
glory the splendor of men and of angels, that, as it
were, these do not appear in heaven.<a id="FNanchor_1333" href="#Footnote_1333" class="fnanchor">[1333]</a> Whence St.
Bernardine of Sienna agrees with St. Bernard in asserting
that the blessed participate in part in the
divine glory, but that the Virgin, in a certain manner,
has been so enriched with it, that it seems no creature
could be more united with God than is Mary.<a id="FNanchor_1334" href="#Footnote_1334" class="fnanchor">[1334]</a> Which
is confirmed by the blessed Albertus Magnus, when
he says that our queen contemplates God very near,
incomparably more so than all the other celestial
spirits.<a id="FNanchor_1335" href="#Footnote_1335" class="fnanchor">[1335]</a> And the above-named St. Bernardine says,
moreover, that as the other planets are illuminated by
the sun, so all the blessed receive greater light and
joy from the sight of Mary.<a id="FNanchor_1336" href="#Footnote_1336" class="fnanchor">[1336]</a> And in another place
he likewise asserts, that the mother of God, ascending
to heaven, increased the joy of all its inhabitants.<a id="FNanchor_1337" href="#Footnote_1337" class="fnanchor">[1337]</a>
Hence St. Peter Damian says, that the blessed have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_511"></a>[511]</span>
no greater glory in heaven, after God, than to enjoy
the presence of that most beautiful queen: “Summa
gloria est post Deum te videre.”<a id="FNanchor_1338" href="#Footnote_1338" class="fnanchor">[1338]</a> And St. Bonaventure:
Next to God, our greatest glory and our greatest
joy is from Mary.<a id="FNanchor_1339" href="#Footnote_1339" class="fnanchor">[1339]</a></p>

<p>Let us rejoice, then, with Mary, in the exalted
throne to which God has elevated her in heaven.
And let us rejoice also for our own sake, since if our
mother has ceased to be present with us, by ascending in
glory to heaven, she has not ceased to be present with
us in her affection. Nay, being there nearer and
more united to God, she better knows our miseries,
and therefore pities them more, and is better able to
relieve us. And wilt thou, as St. Peter Damian asks,
oh blessed Virgin, because thou hast been so exalted
in heaven, be forgetful of us miserable creatures?<a id="FNanchor_1340" href="#Footnote_1340" class="fnanchor">[1340]</a>
No, may God preserve us from the thought; a heart
so merciful cannot but pity our miseries which are so
great.<a id="FNanchor_1341" href="#Footnote_1341" class="fnanchor">[1341]</a> If the pity of Mary for us was so great when
she lived upon earth, much greater, says St. Bonaventure,
is it in heaven, where she reigns.<a id="FNanchor_1342" href="#Footnote_1342" class="fnanchor">[1342]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile let us dedicate ourselves to the service<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_512"></a>[512]</span>
of this queen, to honor and love her as much as we
can; for she is not, as Richard of St. Lawrence says,
like other rulers, who oppress their vassals with burdens
and taxes, but our queen enriches her servants
with graces, merits, and rewards.<a id="FNanchor_1343" href="#Footnote_1343" class="fnanchor">[1343]</a> And let us pray
her with Guerric the Abbot: Oh mother of mercy,
thou who sittest so near to God, queen of the world,
upon a throne so sublime, satiate thyself with the
glory of thy Jesus, and send to us thy servants the
fragments that are left. Thou dost now enjoy the
banquet of the Lord; we who are still on earth, like
the dogs under the table, ask thy pity.<a id="FNanchor_1344" href="#Footnote_1344" class="fnanchor">[1344]</a></p>

<h5>EXAMPLE.</h5>

<p>Father Silvanus Razzi relates,<a id="FNanchor_1345" href="#Footnote_1345" class="fnanchor">[1345]</a> that a devout ecclesiastic
who had a tender love for our Queen Mary,
had heard her beauty so much extolled that he
ardently desired once to see his Lady, and with
humble prayers asked this favor. The kind mother
sent an angel to tell him that she would gratify him
by allowing him to see her, but on this condition,
namely, that after seeing her he should become blind.
He accepted the condition. On a certain day, behold
the blessed Virgin appeared to him, and that he might<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_513"></a>[513]</span>
not become wholly blind, he at first wished to look at
her with one eye only; but afterwards becoming enamored
of the great beauty of Mary, he wished to contemplate
her with both, and then the mother of God disappeared.
Deeply grieved at having lost the presence
of his queen, he could not cease weeping; not indeed
for his lost eye, but that he had not seen her with
both. Then he began to supplicate her anew, that she
would again appear to him, and he would be willing
to lose the other eye and become entirely blind.
“Happy and satisfied,” oh my Lady, he said, “I will
remain, if I become wholly blind for so good a cause,
which will leave me more enamored of thee, and of
thy beauty.” Again Mary was willing to satisfy him,
and again she consoled him with her presence; but
because this loving queen can never injure any one,
when she appeared to him the second time, not only
she did not take from him the other eye, but she even
restored to him the one he had lost.</p>

<h5>PRAYER.</h5>

<p>Oh great, excellent, and most glorious Lady, prostrate
at the foot of thy throne, we adore thee from
this valley of tears. We rejoice at the immense glory
with which our Lord has enriched thee. Now that
thou art really queen of heaven and of earth, ah, do
not forget us thy poor servants. Do not disdain from
thy lofty throne, from which thou dost reign, to turn
thy pitying eyes towards us miserable sinners. As
thou art so near the source of graces, thou art able<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_514"></a>[514]</span>
so much the more to obtain them for us. In heaven
thou seest more plainly our miseries, and therefore
thou must pity and relieve us the more. Make us on
earth thy faithful servants, that we may thus go to
bless thee in paradise. On this day, when thou hast
been made queen of the universe, we also consecrate
ourselves to thy service. In thy great joy console us
also this day, by accepting us for thy vassals. Thou,
then, art our mother. Ah, most sweet mother! most
amiable mother! thy altars are surrounded by many
people who ask of thee, one to be healed of some
malady, another to be relieved in his necessities, one
prays thee for a good harvest, and another success in
some litigation. We ask of thee graces more pleasing
to thy heart. Obtain for us that we may be humble,
detached from earth, resigned to the divine will.
Obtain for us the holy love of God, a good death,
and paradise. Oh Lady, change us from sinners to
saints. Perform this miracle that will redound more
to thy honor, than if thou didst restore sight to a
thousand blind persons, or raise a thousand from the
dead. Thou art so powerful with God, it is enough
to say that thou art his mother, his most beloved, full
of his grace; what can he then deny thee? Oh most
lovely queen, we do not pretend to behold thee on the
earth, but we desire to go and see thee in paradise;
thou must obtain this for us. Thus we certainly hope.
Amen, amen.</p>

<span class="smaller">ON THE DOLORS OF MARY.</span></h4>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>Mary was queen of martyrs, because her martyrdom was longer
and greater than that of all the martyrs.</i></p>

</div>

<p>Who can have a heart so hard that it will not melt
on hearing of a most lamentable event which once
happened in the world? There was a noble and holy
mother who had but one only Son; and he was the
most amiable that could be imagined, innocent, virtuous,
beautiful, and most loving towards his mother;
so much so, that he never had caused her the least
displeasure, but always had showed her all respect,
obedience, and affection. Hence the mother had placed
on this Son all her earthly affections. Now what
happened? It happened that this Son, through envy,
was falsely accused by his enemies, and the judge,
although he knew and confessed his innocence, yet,
that he might not offend his enemies, condemned
him to an infamous death, precisely as they had requested
him to do. And this poor mother had to
suffer the affliction of seeing that amiable and beloved
Son so unjustly taken from her, in the flower of his
age, by a barbarous death; for he was made to die
in torment, drained of his blood before her own eyes,
in a public place, upon an infamous gibbet. Devout<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_516"></a>[516]</span>
souls, what do you say? Is this case and this unhappy
mother worthy of compassion? Already you
know of whom I speak. This Son so cruelly slain was
our loving Redeemer, Jesus, and this mother was the
blessed Virgin Mary, who, for love of us, was willing
to see him offered up to the divine justice by the barbarity
of men. This great pain, then, which Mary
suffered for us—a pain which was more than a thousand
deaths—merits our compassion and gratitude.
And if we can return nothing else for so much love,
at least let us for a little time to-day stop to consider
the severity of the suffering by which Mary became
queen of martyrs; for her great martyrdom exceeded
in suffering that of all the martyrs,—being, in the first
place, the longest martyrdom; and in the second
place, the greatest martyrdom.</p>

<p><i>First Point.</i>—As Jesus is called King of sorrows
and King of martyrs, because he suffered in his life
more than all the other martyrs, so is also Mary called,
with reason, queen of the martyrs, having merited this
title by suffering the greatest martyrdom that could
be suffered, next to that of her Son. Hence she was
justly named by Richard of St. Laurence, the martyr
of martyrs: “Martyr martyrum.” And to her may
be applied what Isaias said: He will crown thee with
the crown of tribulation: “Coronans coronabit te
tribulatione.”<a id="FNanchor_1346" href="#Footnote_1346" class="fnanchor">[1346]</a> For that suffering itself which exceeded
the suffering of all the other martyrs united, was the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_517"></a>[517]</span>
crown by which she was shown to be the queen of
martyrs. That Mary was a true martyr cannot be
doubted, as is proved by the Carthusian, Pelbart,
Catharinus, and others; for it is an established opinion
that suffering sufficient to cause death, constitutes
martyrdom, although death may not then take place.
St. John the Evangelist is revered as a martyr, although
he did not die in the caldron of boiling oil, but came
out more sound than he went in: “Vegetior exiverit
quam intraverit.”<a id="FNanchor_1347" href="#Footnote_1347" class="fnanchor">[1347]</a> It is sufficient to procure the
glory of martyrdom, says St. Thomas, that any one
should be obedient even to offer himself to death.<a id="FNanchor_1348" href="#Footnote_1348" class="fnanchor">[1348]</a>
Mary was a martyr, says St. Bernard, not by the
sword of the executioner, but by the bitter sorrow of
her heart.<a id="FNanchor_1349" href="#Footnote_1349" class="fnanchor">[1349]</a> If her body was not wounded by the hand
of the executioner, yet her blessed heart was pierced
by grief at the passion of her Son; a grief sufficient
to cause her not only one, but a thousand deaths.
And from this we shall see that Mary was not only a
true martyr, but that her martyrdom surpassed that
of all the other martyrs, for it was a longer martyrdom,
and, if I may thus express it, all her life was a
long death.</p>

<p>The passion of Jesus commenced with his birth, as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_518"></a>[518]</span>
St. Bernard says;<a id="FNanchor_1350" href="#Footnote_1350" class="fnanchor">[1350]</a> and Mary also, in all things like
unto her Son, suffered her martyrdom through her
whole life. The name of Mary, among its other significations,
as the blessed Albertus Magnus affirms,
signifies a <i>bitter sea</i>: “Mare amarum.” Wherefore
to her is applied the passage of Jeremias: Great as
the sea is thy destruction: “Magna est enim velut
mare contritio tua.”<a id="FNanchor_1351" href="#Footnote_1351" class="fnanchor">[1351]</a> For as the sea is all salt and
bitter, thus the life of Mary was always full of bitterness
at the sight of the passion of the Redeemer, which
was ever present to her. It cannot be doubted that
being more enlightened by the Holy Spirit than all
the prophets, she better comprehended than they the
predictions concerning the Messias, which they recorded
in their holy Scriptures. Precisely this the
angel revealed to St. Bridget.<a id="FNanchor_1352" href="#Footnote_1352" class="fnanchor">[1352]</a> Whence, as the same
angel declared, the Virgin knowing how much the incarnate
Word was to suffer for the salvation of men,
even before she became his mother, and compassionating
this innocent Saviour, who was to be so cruelly
put to death for crimes not his own, she commenced,
from that time, her great martyrdom.<a id="FNanchor_1353" href="#Footnote_1353" class="fnanchor">[1353]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_519"></a>[519]</span></p>

<p>Her grief afterwards increased immeasurably when
she was made mother of this Saviour. So that at
the painful thought of all the sufferings which her
poor Son was to endure, she indeed experienced, says
Rupert the Abbot, a long martyrdom—a martyrdom
continued through her whole life.<a id="FNanchor_1354" href="#Footnote_1354" class="fnanchor">[1354]</a> And exactly this
was signified by the vision which St. Bridget had at
Rome, in the church of St. Mary Major, where the
blessed Virgin appeared to her with St. Simeon, and
an angel, having a sword which was very long and red
with blood; by which was prefigured the long and
bitter grief that pierced the heart of Mary during her
whole life.<a id="FNanchor_1355" href="#Footnote_1355" class="fnanchor">[1355]</a> Whence the above-named Rupert puts
into the mouth of Mary the following words: Oh
redeemed souls and my beloved children, do not pity
me only for that hour in which I saw my dear Jesus
dying in my presence, for the sword of sorrow, predicted
to me by Simeon, pierced my soul during my
whole life; when I was giving suck to my Son, when
I was warming him in my arms, I already saw the
bitter death that awaited him; consider then what
long and cruel sorrows I must have endured.<a id="FNanchor_1356" href="#Footnote_1356" class="fnanchor">[1356]</a></p>

<p>Wherefore Mary might truly say in the words of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_520"></a>[520]</span>
David: My life is wasted with grief and my years in
sighs.<a id="FNanchor_1357" href="#Footnote_1357" class="fnanchor">[1357]</a> My sorrow is continually before me: “Dolor
meus in conspectu meo semper.”<a id="FNanchor_1358" href="#Footnote_1358" class="fnanchor">[1358]</a> My life was wholly
passed in grief and tears; for my grief, which was
compassion for my beloved Son, never departed from
before my eyes, seeing, as I did, continually the sufferings
and death that he was one day to endure. The
divine mother herself revealed to St. Bridget, that
even after the death and ascension of her Son into
heaven, the memory of his passion, whether she ate or
worked, was deeply impressed and ever recent in her
tender heart.<a id="FNanchor_1359" href="#Footnote_1359" class="fnanchor">[1359]</a> Taulerus therefore says, that Mary
passed her whole life in perpetual sorrow; for her
heart was always occupied with thoughts of sadness
and of suffering.<a id="FNanchor_1360" href="#Footnote_1360" class="fnanchor">[1360]</a></p>

<p>So that time, which usually mitigates the sorrows
of the afflicted, did not relieve Mary; nay, time itself
increased her sorrow, for as Jesus increased in years,
on the one hand, he continually showed himself more
lovely and amiable; and on the other, the time of his
death was ever drawing nearer, and grief at having to
lose him on this earth, continually increased in the
heart of Mary. As the rose grows up among thorns,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_521"></a>[521]</span>
said the angel to St. Bridget, so the mother of God
advanced in years in the midst of sufferings; and as
the thorns increase with the growth of the rose, thus
this rose selected by the Lord, Mary, as she increased
in age, was so much the more pierced by the thorns
of her dolors.<a id="FNanchor_1361" href="#Footnote_1361" class="fnanchor">[1361]</a> Having considered the length of this
suffering, let us now pass on to the second point,
namely, the consideration of its greatness.</p>

<p><i>Point Second.</i>—Ah, Mary was not only queen of
the martyrs, because her martyrdom was longer than
that of all others, but also because it was the greatest
of all. But who can measure its greatness? Jeremias
appears to be unable to find any one with whom
he may compare this mother of sorrows, when considering
her great suffering at the death of her Son.
“To what shall I compare thee, or to what shall I
liken thee, oh daughter of Jerusalem; for great as the
sea is thy destruction; who shall heal thee?”<a id="FNanchor_1362" href="#Footnote_1362" class="fnanchor">[1362]</a> Wherefore
Cardinal Hugo, commenting on these words, says:
Oh blessed Virgin, as the bitterness of the sea exceeds
all other bitterness, so thy grief surpasses all other
griefs.<a id="FNanchor_1363" href="#Footnote_1363" class="fnanchor">[1363]</a> Hence St. Anselm affirms, that if God, by a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_522"></a>[522]</span>
special miracle, had not preserved the life of Mary,
her grief would have been sufficient to cause her death
at each moment of her life.<a id="FNanchor_1364" href="#Footnote_1364" class="fnanchor">[1364]</a> And St. Bernardine of
Sienna even says, that the grief of Mary was so great,
that if it were divided among all men, it would be
enough to cause their immediate death.<a id="FNanchor_1365" href="#Footnote_1365" class="fnanchor">[1365]</a></p>

<p>But let us consider the reasons why the martyrdom
of Mary was greater than that of all the martyrs. In
the first place, it must be remembered that the martyrs
suffered their martyrdom in the body, by means of
fire or steel; Mary suffered martyrdom in her soul, as
St. Simeon had before prophesied: And thy own soul
a sword shall pierce: “Et tuam ipsius animam pertransibit
gladius:”<a id="FNanchor_1366" href="#Footnote_1366" class="fnanchor">[1366]</a> as if the holy old man had said
to her: Oh holy Virgin, the bodies of the other martyrs
will be torn with iron, but thou wilt be pierced
and martyred in thy soul, by the passion of thy own
Son. Now, as the soul is more noble than the body,
so much greater was the suffering of Mary than that
of all the martyrs; as Jesus Christ himself said to
St. Catharine of Sienna: There is no comparison between
the sufferings of the soul and the body: “Inter
dolorem animæ et corporis nulla est comparatio.”
Whence the holy abbot Arnold Carnotensis says, that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_523"></a>[523]</span>
whoever had been present on Calvary at the great
sacrifice of the immaculate Lamb, when he was dying
on the cross, would have there beheld two great altars,
one in the body of Jesus, the other in the heart of
Mary; for there, at the same time that the Son sacrificed
his body in death, Mary sacrificed her soul in
compassion.<a id="FNanchor_1367" href="#Footnote_1367" class="fnanchor">[1367]</a></p>

<p>Moreover, while the other martyrs, as St. Antoninus
says,<a id="FNanchor_1368" href="#Footnote_1368" class="fnanchor">[1368]</a> suffered by sacrificing their own lives, the blessed
Virgin suffered by sacrificing the life of her Son, whom
she loved far more than her own life; so that she not
only suffered in spirit all that her Son suffered in body,
but, moreover, the sight of the sufferings of her Son
brought more grief to her heart than if she had endured
them all in her own person. There can be no
doubt that Mary suffered in her heart all the tortures
by which she saw her beloved Jesus tormented.
Every one knows that the sufferings of children are
also the sufferings of their mothers, when they are
the witnesses of them. St. Augustine, considering
the anguish that the mother of the Macchabees experienced
in witnessing the tortures which her sons
endured, says: “She suffered in them all, because she
loved them all; and endured with her eyes what they
all endured in the flesh.”<a id="FNanchor_1369" href="#Footnote_1369" class="fnanchor">[1369]</a> Thus also was it with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_524"></a>[524]</span>
Mary; all those torments, scourgings, thorns, nails,
and the cross, which tortured the innocent flesh of
Jesus, entered at the same time into the heart of Mary
to complete her martyrdom. He in the flesh, she in
the heart suffered, writes St. Amadeus: “Ille carne,
illa corde passa est.”<a id="FNanchor_1370" href="#Footnote_1370" class="fnanchor">[1370]</a> So that, as St. Lawrence Justinian
says, the heart of Mary became as it were a
mirror of the agonies of her Son, in which were seen
the spitting, the scourging, the wounds, and all that
Jesus suffered.<a id="FNanchor_1371" href="#Footnote_1371" class="fnanchor">[1371]</a> And St. Bonaventure remarks, that
these wounds which were scattered all over the body
of Jesus, were all united in the one heart of Mary.<a id="FNanchor_1372" href="#Footnote_1372" class="fnanchor">[1372]</a></p>

<p>The Virgin, then, through compassion for her Son,
was scourged, crowned with thorns, insulted, and
nailed to the cross. Whence the same saint considering
Mary on Mt. Calvary, where she was present
with her dying Son, asks of her: Oh Lady, tell me
where you then stood? Perhaps only at the foot of
the cross! Might I not rather say thou wast on the
cross itself crucified with thy Son?<a id="FNanchor_1373" href="#Footnote_1373" class="fnanchor">[1373]</a> And Richard,
remarking on the words of the Redeemer, which he
spoke by the mouth of Isaias: “I have trodden the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_525"></a>[525]</span>
wine-press alone, and of the Gentiles there is not a
man with me,”<a id="FNanchor_1374" href="#Footnote_1374" class="fnanchor">[1374]</a> adds: Oh Lord, thou dost rightly
say that in the work of human redemption thou didst
suffer alone, and there was no man that could pity
thee sufficiently; but there was a woman with thee,
thy own mother, who suffered in her heart whatever
thou didst suffer in thy body.<a id="FNanchor_1375" href="#Footnote_1375" class="fnanchor">[1375]</a></p>

<p>But all this is saying only too little of the sorrows
of Mary; for, as I have before said, she suffered more
in seeing her beloved Jesus suffer, than if in her own
person she had endured all the tortures and the death
of her Son. Erasmus has written, speaking of parents,
generally, that they feel the sufferings of their
children more than their own.<a id="FNanchor_1376" href="#Footnote_1376" class="fnanchor">[1376]</a> But this is not always
true. It was no doubt true of Mary, for she
certainly loved her Son and his life far more than herself,
and a thousand lives of her own. Therefore St.
Amadeus well declares, that the afflicted mother, at
the sorrowful sight of the agony of her beloved Jesus,
suffered much more than if she herself had endured
his whole passion.<a id="FNanchor_1377" href="#Footnote_1377" class="fnanchor">[1377]</a> The reason is plain, since, as St.
Bernard says: The soul is more where it loves, than<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_526"></a>[526]</span>
where it lives: “Anima magis est ubi amat, quam ubi
animat.” And the Saviour himself had before said,
that our heart is where our treasure is.<a id="FNanchor_1378" href="#Footnote_1378" class="fnanchor">[1378]</a> If Mary,
then, through love, lived more in her Son than in herself,
a much greater grief did she suffer at the death
of her Son, than if the most cruel death in the world
had been inflicted on her.</p>

<p>And here is to be considered the other circumstance
that rendered the martyrdom of Mary far greater than
the sufferings of all the martyrs, for in the passion of
Jesus she suffered much, and she suffered without alleviation.
The martyrs suffered under the torments
which their tyrants inflicted upon them, but love to
Jesus rendered their pains sweet and delightful. A St.
Vincent suffered in his martyrdom; he was tortured on
the rack, torn with hooks, burned with red-hot iron
plates; but St. Augustine says: One seemed to suffer,
and another to speak: “Alius videbatur pati, alius
loqui.” The saint addressed the tyrant with such
power, and with such contempt of his torments, that
it seemed as if one Vincent suffered and another Vincent
spoke, so greatly did his God, with the sweetness
of his love, comfort him in the midst of his sufferings.
A St. Boniface suffered; his body was torn
with irons, sharp-pointed reeds were thrust between
his nails and flesh, melted lead was poured into his
mouth, and at the same time he could not often enough
repeat: I give thanks to thee, oh Jesus Christ:
“Gratias tibi ago, Domine Jesu Christe.” A St.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_527"></a>[527]</span>
Mark and a St. Marcellinus suffered; they were
bound to a stake, their feet pierced by nails, and the
tyrant appealed to them, saying: “Miserable beings,
look at your condition, and save yourselves from these
torments.” And they answered: “What torments,
what pains do you speak of? We have never feasted
with more joy than now, when we are suffering with
pleasure for the love of Jesus Christ.”<a id="FNanchor_1379" href="#Footnote_1379" class="fnanchor">[1379]</a> A St. Lawrence
suffered, but while he was burning on the gridiron,
the interior flame of love, as St. Leo says, was
more powerful to cheer his soul, than the flames without
were to torture his body.<a id="FNanchor_1380" href="#Footnote_1380" class="fnanchor">[1380]</a> Hence love made
him so strong, that he even braved the tyrant by
saying to him: Tyrant, if you wish to feed on my
flesh, a part is sufficiently cooked, turn and eat: “Assatum
est jam, versa et manduca.” But in such torture
and lingering death, how could the saint thus
exult? Ah, St. Augustine answers, because, intoxicated
with the wine of divine love, he felt neither
torments nor death.<a id="FNanchor_1381" href="#Footnote_1381" class="fnanchor">[1381]</a></p>

<p>For the holy martyrs, the more they loved Jesus,
the less they felt torments and death, and the sight
alone of the sufferings of a crucified God was sufficient
to console them. But was not our afflicted
mother, also, thus consoled by love for her Son, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_528"></a>[528]</span>
the sight of his sufferings? No, for this very Son
who suffered, was the whole cause of her grief; and
the love she bore him was her only, and too cruel
executioner; for the whole martyrdom of Mary consisted
in seeing and pitying her innocent and beloved
Son, who suffered so much. Therefore, the more she
loved him, the more bitter and inconsolable was her
sorrow. “Great as the sea is thy destruction, who
shall heal thee?”<a id="FNanchor_1382" href="#Footnote_1382" class="fnanchor">[1382]</a> Ah, queen of heaven, love hath
alleviated the sufferings of other martyrs, and has
healed their wounds; but who has ever soothed thy
great sorrow? Who has ever healed the cruel wounds
of thy heart? Who will heal thee? “Quis medebitur
tui?” if that same Son, who could give thee consolation,
was by his sufferings the sole cause of thy
sorrows, and the love that thou didst bear him, caused
all thy martyrdom? Therefore, whilst the other martyrs,
as Diez remarks, are all represented with the instrument
of their passion—St. Paul with the sword,
St. Andrew with the cross, St. Lawrence with the
gridiron—Mary is represented with her dead Son in
her arms, because Jesus himself alone was the instrument
of her martyrdom, by reason of the love which
she bore him. In a few words St. Bernard confirms
all I have said: With the other martyrs their great
love soothed the anguish of their martyrdom; but the
more the blessed Virgin loved, so much the more she
suffered, and so much more cruel was her martyrdom.<a id="FNanchor_1383" href="#Footnote_1383" class="fnanchor">[1383]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_529"></a>[529]</span></p>

<p>It is certain that the greater is our love for a thing,
the greater pain we feel in losing it. The loss of a
brother certainly afflicts us more than the loss of a
beast of burden; and the death of a son, more than
that of a friend. Now Cornelius à Lapide says, that
to comprehend how great was the grief of Mary at
the death of her Son, we should comprehend how
great was the love she bore him.<a id="FNanchor_1384" href="#Footnote_1384" class="fnanchor">[1384]</a> But who can
measure that love? The blessed Amadeus says, that
in the heart of Mary two kinds of love to her Jesus
were united: the supernatural love with which she
loved him as her God, and the natural love with
which she loved him as her son;<a id="FNanchor_1385" href="#Footnote_1385" class="fnanchor">[1385]</a> so that, of these
two loves, one only was formed, but a love so immense
that William of Paris even said, that the blessed
Virgin loved Jesus to such a degree that a pure
creature could not love him more.<a id="FNanchor_1386" href="#Footnote_1386" class="fnanchor">[1386]</a> And Richard of
St. Laurence says, as there was no love like her love,
so there was no grief like her grief.<a id="FNanchor_1387" href="#Footnote_1387" class="fnanchor">[1387]</a> If, therefore,
the love of Mary for her Son was immense, immense,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_530"></a>[530]</span>
also, must have been her grief in losing him by death.
Where love is greatest, says blessed Albertus Magnus,
there grief is greatest: “Ubi summus amor, ibi summus
dolor.”</p>

<p>Let us imagine, then, that the divine mother, standing
near her Son dying upon the cross, and justly
applying to herself the words of Jeremias, says to
us: “Oh, all ye that pass by the way attend, and see
if there be any sorrow like to my sorrow.”<a id="FNanchor_1388" href="#Footnote_1388" class="fnanchor">[1388]</a> Oh ye
that are passing your lives upon this earth, and have
no pity for me, stop a while to look upon me, now
that I behold this beloved Son dying before my eyes;
and then see if among all who are afflicted and tormented,
there be sorrow like to my sorrow. No,
answers St. Bonaventure, there can be found no sorrow,
oh afflicted mother, more bitter than thine, for
no son can be found more dear than thine.<a id="FNanchor_1389" href="#Footnote_1389" class="fnanchor">[1389]</a> Ah,
there has never been in the world, says St. Lawrence
Justinian, a son more worthy of love than Jesus, nor
a mother who loved her son more than Mary; if, then,
there has never been in the world a love like the love
of Mary, how can there be a grief like the grief of
Mary?<a id="FNanchor_1390" href="#Footnote_1390" class="fnanchor">[1390]</a></p>

<p>Therefore, St. Ildephonsus did not hesitate to affirm,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_531"></a>[531]</span>
that it was little to say that the sufferings of the Virgin
exceeded all the torments of the martyrs, even
were they united together.<a id="FNanchor_1391" href="#Footnote_1391" class="fnanchor">[1391]</a> And St. Anselm adds,
that the most cruel tortures inflicted upon the holy
martyrs were light or nothing, in comparison with the
martyrdom of Mary.<a id="FNanchor_1392" href="#Footnote_1392" class="fnanchor">[1392]</a> St. Basil likewise writes, that
as the sun surpasses in splendor all the other planets,
so Mary in her sufferings exceeded the sufferings of
all the other martyrs.<a id="FNanchor_1393" href="#Footnote_1393" class="fnanchor">[1393]</a> A certain learned author<a id="FNanchor_1394" href="#Footnote_1394" class="fnanchor">[1394]</a>
concludes with an admirable sentiment, saying, that so
great was the sorrow which this tender mother suffered
in the passion of Jesus, that she alone could
worthily compassionate the death of a God made
man.</p>

<p>But St. Bonaventure, addressing the blessed Virgin,
says: Oh Lady, why hast thou wished to go and sacrifice
thyself also on Calvary? Was not a crucified
God sufficient to redeem us, that thou his mother
wouldst be crucified also?<a id="FNanchor_1395" href="#Footnote_1395" class="fnanchor">[1395]</a> Indeed, the death of
Jesus was more than enough to save the world, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_532"></a>[532]</span>
also an infinity of worlds; but this good mother
wished, for the love she bore us, likewise to aid
the cause of our salvation with the merits of the sorrows
which she offered for us on Calvary. And,
therefore, says the blessed Albertus Magnus, as we
are indebted to Jesus for what he suffered for love of
us, we are also indebted to Mary for the martyrdom
which she, in the death of her Son, voluntarily suffered
for our salvation.<a id="FNanchor_1396" href="#Footnote_1396" class="fnanchor">[1396]</a> I have added voluntarily,
since, as the angel revealed to St. Bridget, this our so
merciful and kind mother was willing to suffer any
pain, rather than to see souls unredeemed or left in their
former perdition.<a id="FNanchor_1397" href="#Footnote_1397" class="fnanchor">[1397]</a> It may be said that this was the
only consolation of Mary in the midst of her great
sorrow at the passion of her Son, to see the lost
world redeemed by his death, and men, who were his
enemies, reconciled with God. Grieving, she rejoiced,
says Simon da Cassia, because the sacrifice was offered
for the redemption of all, by which wrath was
appeased.<a id="FNanchor_1398" href="#Footnote_1398" class="fnanchor">[1398]</a></p>

<p>Such love as that of Mary merits our gratitude,
and let us show our gratitude by meditating upon and
compassionating her sorrows. But of this she complained
to St. Bridget, that very few pitied her, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_533"></a>[533]</span>
most lived forgetful of her sorrows. “I look around
upon all who are in the world, if perchance there
may be any to pity me, and meditate upon my
sorrows, and truly I find very few. Therefore, my
daughter, though I am forgotten by many, at least do
not thou forget me; behold my anguish, and imitate,
as far as thou canst, my grief.”<a id="FNanchor_1399" href="#Footnote_1399" class="fnanchor">[1399]</a> In order to understand
how much the Virgin is pleased by our remembrance
of her dolors, it is sufficient to relate, that in
the year 1239, she appeared to seven of her servants,
who then became the founders of the order of the
Servants of Mary, with a black garment in her hand,
and told them that if they wished to please her, they
should often meditate upon her dolors; and therefore
she wished, in memory of them, that they would hereafter
wear that garment of mourning.<a id="FNanchor_1400" href="#Footnote_1400" class="fnanchor">[1400]</a> And Jesus
Christ himself revealed to the blessed Veronica Binasco,
that he takes more pleasure, as it were, in seeing
his mother compassionated than himself; for thus he
addressed her: “My daughter, the tears shed for my
passion are dear to me; but loving with so great love
my mother Mary, the meditation of the dolors which
she suffered at my death is more dear to me.”<a id="FNanchor_1401" href="#Footnote_1401" class="fnanchor">[1401]</a></p>

<p>Wherefore the graces are very great which Jesus<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_534"></a>[534]</span>
promises to those who are devoted to the dolors
of Mary. Pelbart relates,<a id="FNanchor_1402" href="#Footnote_1402" class="fnanchor">[1402]</a> that it was revealed to St.
Elizabeth, that St. John the Evangelist, after the
blessed Virgin was assumed into heaven, desired to
see her again. This favor was granted him; his dear
mother appeared to him, and Jesus Christ with her;
and he then heard Mary asking of her Son some peculiar
grace for those who were devoted to her dolors;
and Jesus promised her for them the four following
special graces: 1st. That those who invoke the
divine mother by her sorrows, before death will merit
to obtain true repentance of all their sins. 2d. That
he will protect such in their tribulations, especially at
the hour of death. 3d. That he will impress upon
them the memory of his passion, and that they shall
have their reward for it in heaven. 4th. That he
will commit such devout servants to the hands of Mary,
that she may dispose of them according to her pleasure,
and obtain for them all the graces she desires.
In proof of this, let us see in the following example
how devotion to the dolors of Mary may aid our eternal
salvation.</p>

<h5>EXAMPLE.</h5>

<p>We read in the revelations of St. Bridget,<a id="FNanchor_1403" href="#Footnote_1403" class="fnanchor">[1403]</a> that
there was once a lord as noble by birth as he was low
and sinful in his habits. He had given himself by an
express compact as a slave to the devil, and had served
him for sixty successive years, leading such a life as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_535"></a>[535]</span>
may easily be imagined, and never approaching the
sacraments. Now, this prince was about to die, and
Jesus Christ, in his compassion, commanded St.
Bridget to tell his confessor to visit him, and exhort
him to make his confession. The confessor went, and
the sick man told him that he had no need of a confessor,
for that he had often made his confession.
The confessor visited him a second time, and that poor
slave of hell persevered in his obstinate determination
not to make his confession. Jesus again directed the
saint to tell the confessor to go to him again. He
obeyed, and this third time related to him the revelation
made to the saint, and that he had returned so
many times because the Lord, who desired to show
him mercy, had directed him to do so. On hearing
this, the dying man was moved, and began to weep.
But how, he exclaimed, can I be pardoned, when for
sixty years I have served the devil, made myself his
slave, and have laden my soul with innumerable sins?
“Son,” answered the father, encouraging him, “do not
doubt: if you repent of them, in the name of God
I promise you pardon.” Then beginning to gain confidence,
he said to the confessor: “Father, I believed
myself lost, and despaired of salvation; but now I feel
a sorrow for my sins, which encourages me to trust;
and as God has not yet abandoned me, I wish to make
my confession.” And in fact on that day he made his
confession four times, with great sorrow; the next day he
received communion, and on the sixth he died, contrite
and entirely resigned. After his death, Jesus Christ<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_536"></a>[536]</span>
further revealed to St. Bridget, that this sinner was
saved, and was in purgatory, and that he had been
saved by the intercession of the Virgin, his mother;
for the deceased, although he had led so sinful a life,
yet had always preserved devotion to her dolors,
whenever he remembered them he pitied her.</p>

<h5>PRAYER.</h5>

<p>Oh my afflicted mother! queen of martyrs and of
sorrows, thou hast shed so many tears for thy Son,
who died for my salvation, and yet what will thy tears
avail me, if I am lost? By the merits, then, of thy
dolors, obtain for me a true sorrow for my sins, and a
true amendment of life, with a perpetual and tender
compassion for the passion of Jesus and thy own sufferings.
And if Jesus and thou, being so innocent,
have suffered so much for me, obtain for me that I,
who am deserving of hell, may also suffer something
for love of you. Oh Lady, I will say to thee with
St. Bonaventure, if I have offended thee, wound my
heart in punishment; if I have served thee, now I
beg to be wounded as a reward. It is a shameful
thing to see our Lord Jesus wounded, and thee
wounded with him, and I uninjured.<a id="FNanchor_1404" href="#Footnote_1404" class="fnanchor">[1404]</a> Finally, oh
my mother, by the grief thou didst experience on
seeing thy Son before thy eyes bow his head and expire<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_537"></a>[537]</span>
upon the cross, I entreat of thee to obtain for me
a good death. Ah, do not cease, oh advocate of sinners,
to assist my afflicted and struggling soul in that
great passage that it has to make into eternity. And,
because at that time it may easily be the case that I
shall have lost the use of speech with which to invoke
thy name, and that of Jesus, who are all my hope,
therefore I now invoke thy Son and thee to succor
me at that last moment, and I say: Jesus and Mary,
to you I commend my soul. Amen.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="REFLECTIONS">REFLECTIONS
ON EACH OF THE SEVEN DOLORS OF MARY IN PARTICULAR.</h3>

</div>

<h4 id="DOLOR_I">ON THE FIRST DOLOR.<br>
OF ST. SIMEON’S PROPHECY.</h4>

<p>In this valley of tears, every man is born to weep,
and every one must suffer those afflictions that daily
befall him. But how much more miserable would life
be, if every one knew also the future evils which are
to afflict him! Too unhappy would he be, says Seneca,
whose fate was such.<a id="FNanchor_1405" href="#Footnote_1405" class="fnanchor">[1405]</a> The Lord exercises this compassion
towards us, namely, that he does not make<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_538"></a>[538]</span>
known to us the crosses that await us; that if we are
to suffer them, at least we may suffer them only once.
But he did not exercise this compassion with Mary,
who, because God wished her to be queen of dolors,
and in all things like his Son, had to see always before
her eyes, and to suffer continually all the sorrows that
awaited her; and those were the sufferings of the
passion and death of her beloved Jesus. For St.
Simeon in the temple, after having received the divine
child in his arms, predicted to her that this child was
to be the mark for all the opposition and persecution
of men: “Set for a sign which shall be contradicted;”
and that therefore the sword of sorrow should pierce
her soul: “And thy own soul a sword shall pierce.”<a id="FNanchor_1406" href="#Footnote_1406" class="fnanchor">[1406]</a></p>

<p>The holy Virgin herself said to St. Matilda, that at
this announcement of St. Simeon all her joy was
changed into sorrow.<a id="FNanchor_1407" href="#Footnote_1407" class="fnanchor">[1407]</a> For, as it was revealed to St.
Theresa, the blessed mother, although she knew before
this that the life of her Son would be sacrificed
for the salvation of the world, yet she then learned
more particularly and distinctly the sufferings and
cruel death that awaited her poor Son. She knew
that he would be contradicted in all things. Contradicted
in doctrine; for instead of being believed, he
would be esteemed a blasphemer for teaching that he
was the Son of God, as the impious Caiaphas declared
him to be, saying: “He hath blasphemed, he is guilty<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_539"></a>[539]</span>
of death.”<a id="FNanchor_1408" href="#Footnote_1408" class="fnanchor">[1408]</a> Contradicted in his reputation, for he
was noble, of royal lineage, and was despised as a
peasant: “Is not this the carpenter’s son?”<a id="FNanchor_1409" href="#Footnote_1409" class="fnanchor">[1409]</a> “Is
not this the carpenter, the son of Mary?”<a id="FNanchor_1410" href="#Footnote_1410" class="fnanchor">[1410]</a> He was
wisdom itself, and was treated as an ignorant man:
“How doth this man know letters, having never
learned?”<a id="FNanchor_1411" href="#Footnote_1411" class="fnanchor">[1411]</a> As a false prophet: “And they blindfolded
him and smote his face ... saying: Prophesy
who is this that struck thee.”<a id="FNanchor_1412" href="#Footnote_1412" class="fnanchor">[1412]</a> He was treated as a
madman: “He is mad, why hear you him?”<a id="FNanchor_1413" href="#Footnote_1413" class="fnanchor">[1413]</a> As
a wine-bibber, a glutton, and a friend of sinners:
“Behold a man that is a glutton, and a drinker of
wine, a friend of publicans and sinners.”<a id="FNanchor_1414" href="#Footnote_1414" class="fnanchor">[1414]</a> As a
sorcerer: “By the prince of devils he casteth out
devils.”<a id="FNanchor_1415" href="#Footnote_1415" class="fnanchor">[1415]</a> As a heretic and possessed person: “Do
we not say well of thee, that thou art a Samaritan,
and hast a devil?”<a id="FNanchor_1416" href="#Footnote_1416" class="fnanchor">[1416]</a> In a word, Jesus was considered
as so bad and notorious a man, that no trial was necessary
to condemn him, as the Jews said to Pilate: “If
he were not a malefactor, we would not have delivered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_540"></a>[540]</span>
him up to thee.”<a id="FNanchor_1417" href="#Footnote_1417" class="fnanchor">[1417]</a> He was contradicted in his soul,
for even his eternal Father, in order to give place to
the divine justice, contradicted him by not wishing to
hear him when he prayed to him, saying: “Father,
if it be possible, let this chalice pass from me;”<a id="FNanchor_1418" href="#Footnote_1418" class="fnanchor">[1418]</a> and
abandoned him to fear, weariness, and sadness, so that
our afflicted Lord said: “My soul is sorrowful even
unto death.”<a id="FNanchor_1419" href="#Footnote_1419" class="fnanchor">[1419]</a> His interior suffering even caused him
to sweat blood. Contradicted and persecuted, in a
word, in his body and his life, for he was tortured in
all his sacred members: in his hands, in his feet, in
his face, in his head, in his whole body, till, drained to
the last drop of his blood, he died an ignominious
death on the cross.</p>

<p>When David, in the midst of all his pleasures and
royal grandeur, heard from Nathan the prophet that
his son should die—“The child that is born to thee
shall surely die”<a id="FNanchor_1420" href="#Footnote_1420" class="fnanchor">[1420]</a>—he could find no peace, but wept,
fasted, and slept upon the ground. Mary received
with the greatest calmness the announcement that her
Son should die, and peacefully continued to submit to
it; but what grief she must have continually suffered,
seeing this amiable Son always near her, hearing from
him words of eternal life, and beholding his holy demeanor.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_541"></a>[541]</span>
Abraham suffered great affliction during the
three days he passed with his beloved Isaac, after he
knew that he was to lose him. Oh God! not for
three days, but for thirty-three years, Mary had to
endure a like sorrow. Like, do I say? A sorrow as
much greater as the Son of Mary was more lovely
than the son of Abraham. The blessed Virgin herself
revealed to St. Bridget,<a id="FNanchor_1421" href="#Footnote_1421" class="fnanchor">[1421]</a> that while she lived on
the earth there was not an hour when this grief did not
pierce her soul: As often, she continued, as I looked
upon my Son, as often as I wrapped him in his swaddling
clothes, as often as I saw his hands and his feet,
so often was my soul overwhelmed as it were with a
fresh sorrow, because I considered how he would be
crucified.<a id="FNanchor_1422" href="#Footnote_1422" class="fnanchor">[1422]</a> Rupert the Abbot, contemplating Mary,
while she was suckling her Son, imagines her addressing
him in these words: “A bundle of myrrh is my
beloved to me, he shall abide between my breasts.”<a id="FNanchor_1423" href="#Footnote_1423" class="fnanchor">[1423]</a>
Ah, my Son, I clasp thee in my arms, because thou
art so dear to me; but the dearer thou art to me,
the more thou dost become to me a bundle of myrrh
and of sorrow, when I think of thy sufferings. Mary,
says St. Bernardine of Sienna,<a id="FNanchor_1424" href="#Footnote_1424" class="fnanchor">[1424]</a> considered that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_542"></a>[542]</span>
strength of the saints was to pass through death; the
beauty of paradise to be deformed; the Lord of the
universe to be bound as a criminal; the Creator of all
things to be livid with stripes; the Judge of all to be
condemned; the glory of heaven despised; the King
of kings to be crowned with thorns, and treated as a
mock king.</p>

<p>Father Engelgrave writes, that it was revealed to
the same St. Bridget, that the afflicted mother, knowing
all that her Son would have to suffer, when suckling
him, thought of the gall and vinegar; when she
swathed him, of the cords with which he was to be
bound; when she bore him in her arms, she thought
of him being nailed to the cross; and when he slept,
she thought of his death.<a id="FNanchor_1425" href="#Footnote_1425" class="fnanchor">[1425]</a> As often as she put
on him his clothes, she reflected that they would
one day be torn from him, that he might be crucified;
and when she beheld his sacred hands and
feet, and thought of the nails that were to pierce
them, as Mary said to St. Bridget: “My eyes
filled with tears, and my heart was tortured with
grief.”<a id="FNanchor_1426" href="#Footnote_1426" class="fnanchor">[1426]</a></p>

<p>The evangelist says, that as Jesus Christ advanced
in years, so also he advanced in wisdom and in grace<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_543"></a>[543]</span>
with God and men.<a id="FNanchor_1427" href="#Footnote_1427" class="fnanchor">[1427]</a> That is, he advanced in wisdom
and in grace before men, or in their estimation; and
before God, according to St. Thomas,<a id="FNanchor_1428" href="#Footnote_1428" class="fnanchor">[1428]</a> inasmuch as
all his works would continually have availed to increase
his merit, if from the beginning grace in its complete
fulness had not been conferred on him by virtue of
the hypostatic union. But if Jesus advanced in the
esteem and love of others, how much more did he
advance in Mary’s love! But, oh God, as love increased
in her, the more increased in her the grief of
having to lose him by a death so cruel. And the
nearer the time of the passion of her Son approached,
with so much greater pain did that sword of sorrow,
predicted by St. Simeon, pierce the heart of the
mother; precisely this the angel revealed to St. Bridget,
saying: “That sword of sorrow was every hour
drawing nearer to the Virgin as the time for the passion
of her Son drew nearer.”<a id="FNanchor_1429" href="#Footnote_1429" class="fnanchor">[1429]</a></p>

<p>If, then, Jesus our King and his most holy mother
did not refuse, for love of us, to suffer during their
whole life such cruel pains, there is no reason that we
should complain if we suffer a little. Jesus crucified
once appeared to sister Magdalene Orsini, a Dominican
nun, when she had been long suffering a great trial,
and encouraged her to remain with him on the cross<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_544"></a>[544]</span>
with that sorrow that was afflicting her. Sister Magdalene
answered him complainingly: “Oh Lord, thou
didst suffer on the cross only three hours, but it is
more than three years that I have been suffering this
cross.” Then the Redeemer replied: “Ah! ignorant
soul, what dost thou say? I, from the first moment
I was conceived, suffered in heart what I afterwards
suffered on the cross.” If, then, we too suffer any
affliction and complain, let us imagine that Jesus and
his mother Mary are saying to us the same words.</p>

<h5>EXAMPLE.</h5>

<p>Father Roviglione, of the Company of Jesus, relates,<a id="FNanchor_1430" href="#Footnote_1430" class="fnanchor">[1430]</a>
that a certain youth practised the devotion of visiting
every day an image of the sorrowful Mary, in which she
was represented with seven swords piercing her heart.
One night the unhappy youth fell into mortal sin.
Going next morning to visit the image, he saw in the
heart of the blessed Virgin not only seven, but eight
swords. As he stood gazing at this, he heard a voice
saying to him, that his sin had added the eighth
sword to the heart of Mary. This softened his hard
heart; he went immediately to confession, and
through the intercession of his advocate, recovered the
divine grace.</p>

<h5>PRAYER.</h5>

<p>Oh my blessed mother, not one sword only, but as
many swords as I have committed sins have I added<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_545"></a>[545]</span>
to those seven in thy heart. Ah, my Lady, thy sorrows
are not due to thee who art innocent, but to me
who am guilty. But since thou hast wished to suffer
so much for me, ah, by thy merits obtain for me great
sorrow for my sins, and patience under the trials of
this life, which will always be light in comparison with
my demerits, for I have often merited hell. Amen.</p>

<h4 id="DOLOR_II">ON THE SECOND DOLOR.<br>
OF THE FLIGHT OF JESUS INTO EGYPT.</h4>

<p>As the stag, wounded by an arrow, carries the pain
with him wherever he goes, because he carries with
him the arrow that has wounded him; thus the divine
mother, after the prophecy of St. Simeon, as we saw
in our consideration of the first grief, always carried
her sorrow with her by the continual remembrance of
the passion of her Son. Ailgrin, explaining this passage
of the Canticles, “The hairs of thy head as the
purple of the king bound in the channel,”<a id="FNanchor_1431" href="#Footnote_1431" class="fnanchor">[1431]</a> says:
These hairs of Mary were her continual thoughts of
the passion of Jesus, which kept always before her
eyes the blood which was one day to flow from his
wounds. Thy mind, oh Mary, and thy thoughts
tinged in the blood of the passion of our Lord, were
always moved with sorrow as if they actually saw the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_546"></a>[546]</span>
blood flowing from his wounds.<a id="FNanchor_1432" href="#Footnote_1432" class="fnanchor">[1432]</a> Thus her Son himself
was that arrow in the heart of Mary, who, the
more worthy of love he showed himself to her, always
wounded her the more with the sorrowful thought
that she should lose him by so cruel a death. Let
us now pass to the consideration of the second sword
of sorrow which wounded Mary, in the flight of her
infant Jesus into Egypt from the persecution of Herod.</p>

<p>Herod having heard that the expected Messiah was
born, foolishly feared that the new-born King would
deprive him of his kingdom. Hence St. Fulgentius,
reproving him for his folly, thus says: “Why,
oh Herod, art thou thus disturbed? This King who
is born has not come to conquer kings by arms, but
to subjugate them, in a wonderful manner, by his
death.”<a id="FNanchor_1433" href="#Footnote_1433" class="fnanchor">[1433]</a> The impious Herod, therefore, waited to
learn from the holy magi where the King was born,
that he might take from him his life; but finding himself
deceived by the magi, he ordered all the infants
that could be found in the neighborhood of Bethlehem
to be put to death. But an angel appeared in a
dream to St. Joseph, and said to him: “Arise, and
take the child and his mother, and fly into Egypt.”<a id="FNanchor_1434" href="#Footnote_1434" class="fnanchor">[1434]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_547"></a>[547]</span>
According to Gerson, immediately, on that very night,
Joseph made this command known to Mary; and
taking the infant Jesus, they commenced their journey,
as it seems clearly from the Gospel itself: “Who
arose and took the child and his mother by night, and
retired into Egypt.” Oh God, as blessed Albertus
Magnus says in the name of Mary, must he, then,
who came to save men flee from men? “Debet fugere
qui salvator est mundi?”<a id="FNanchor_1435" href="#Footnote_1435" class="fnanchor">[1435]</a> And then the afflicted
Mary knew that already the prophecy of Simeon, regarding
her Son, was beginning to be verified: “He is
set for a sign which shall be contradicted.”<a id="FNanchor_1436" href="#Footnote_1436" class="fnanchor">[1436]</a> Seeing
that scarcely is he born, when he is persecuted to
death. What suffering it must have been to the heart
of Mary, writes St. John Chrysostom, to hear the
tidings of that cruel exile of herself with her Son!
Flee from thy friends to strangers, from the holy temple
of the only true God, to the temples of demons.
What greater tribulation than that a new-born child,
clinging to its mother’s bosom, should be forced to
fly with the mother herself!<a id="FNanchor_1437" href="#Footnote_1437" class="fnanchor">[1437]</a></p>

<p>Every one can imagine how much Mary must have
suffered on this journey. It was a long distance to
Egypt. Authors generally agree with Barrada<a id="FNanchor_1438" href="#Footnote_1438" class="fnanchor">[1438]</a> that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_548"></a>[548]</span>
it was four hundred miles; so that at least it was a
journey of thirty days. The way, as St. Bonaventure
describes it, was rough, unknown, through woods, and
little frequented.<a id="FNanchor_1439" href="#Footnote_1439" class="fnanchor">[1439]</a> The season was winter, and therefore
they had to travel in snow, rain, wind, and storms,
and through bad and difficult roads. Mary was then
fifteen years of age, a delicate virgin, unaccustomed
to such journeys. They had no servant to attend
them. Joseph and Mary, said St. Peter Chrysologus,
had no man-servant nor maid-servant; they were
themselves both masters and servants.<a id="FNanchor_1440" href="#Footnote_1440" class="fnanchor">[1440]</a> Oh God, how
piteous a spectacle it was to see that tender Virgin, with
that newly born infant in her arms, wandering through
this world! St. Bonaventure asks, Where did they
obtain food? Where did they rest at night? How
were they lodged?<a id="FNanchor_1441" href="#Footnote_1441" class="fnanchor">[1441]</a> What other food could they have,
than a piece of hard bread which Joseph brought with
him or begged in charity? Where could they have
slept (particularly in the two hundred miles of desert
through which they travelled, where, as authors relate,
there were neither houses nor inns) except on the sand,
or under some tree in the wood, in the open air, exposed
to robbers, or those wild beasts with which
Egypt abounded? Ah, if any one had met these
three greatest personages of the world, what would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_549"></a>[549]</span>
he have believed them to be but three poor, roving
beggars?</p>

<p>They lived in Egypt, according to Brocard and
Jansenius, in a district called Maturea, though, according
to St. Anselm, they dwelt in Heliopolis, first called
Memphis, and now Cairo. And here let us consider
the great poverty they must have suffered for the seven
years they were there, as St. Antoninus, St. Thomas,
and others assert. They were foreigners, unknown, without
revenues, without money, without kindred; hardly
were they able to support themselves by their humble
labors. As they were destitute, says St. Basil, it is manifest
what efforts they must have made to obtain there
the necessaries of life.<a id="FNanchor_1442" href="#Footnote_1442" class="fnanchor">[1442]</a> Moreover, Landolph of Saxony
has written, and let it be repeated for the consolation
of the poor, that so great was the poverty of Mary
there, that sometimes she had not so much as a morsel of
bread, when her Son, forced by hunger, asked it of her.<a id="FNanchor_1443" href="#Footnote_1443" class="fnanchor">[1443]</a></p>

<p>St. Matthew also relates that when Herod was dead,
the angel again appeared, in a dream, to St. Joseph,
and directed him to return to Judea. St. Bonaventure,
speaking of this return, considers the greater
pain of the blessed Virgin, on account of the sufferings
which Jesus must have endured in that journey, having
arrived at about the age of seven years—an age,
says the saint, when he was so large that he could<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_550"></a>[550]</span>
not be carried, and so small that he could not go
without assistance.<a id="FNanchor_1444" href="#Footnote_1444" class="fnanchor">[1444]</a></p>

<p>The sight, then, of Jesus and Mary wandering like
fugitives through this world, teaches us that we
should also live as pilgrims on the earth, detached
from the goods which the world offers us, as having
soon to leave them and go to eternity. “We have
not here a lasting city, but seek one that is to come.”<a id="FNanchor_1445" href="#Footnote_1445" class="fnanchor">[1445]</a>
To which St. Augustine adds: Thou art a stranger,
thou givest a look, and then passest on: “Hospes es,
vides et transis.” It also teaches us to embrace
crosses, for we cannot live in this world without a
cross. The blessed Veronica da Binasco, an Augustinian
nun, was carried in spirit to accompany Mary
and the infant Jesus in this journey to Egypt, and at
the end of it the divine mother said to her: “Child,
hast thou seen through what difficulties we have
reached this place? Now learn that no one receives
graces without suffering.” He who wishes to feel
least the sufferings of this life, must take Jesus and
Mary with him: “Accipe puerum et matrem ejus.”
For him who lovingly bears in his heart this Son and
this mother, all sufferings become light, and even
sweet and dear. Let us then love them, let us console
Mary by receiving her Son within our hearts, whom,
even now, men continue to persecute with their sins.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_551"></a>[551]</span></p>

<h5>EXAMPLE.</h5>

<p>One day the most holy Mary appeared to the
blessed Colletta, a Franciscan nun, and showed her
the infant Jesus in a basin, torn in pieces, and then
said to her: “Thus sinners continually treat my Son,
renewing his death and my sorrows; oh, my daughter,
pray for them that they may be converted.”<a id="FNanchor_1446" href="#Footnote_1446" class="fnanchor">[1446]</a>
Similar to this is that other vision which appeared to
the venerable sister Jane, of Jesus and Mary, also a
Franciscan nun. As she was one day meditating on
the infant Jesus, persecuted by Herod, she heard a
great noise, as of armed people, who were pursuing
some one; and then appeared before her a most
beautiful child, who was fleeing in great distress, and
cried to her: “My Jane, help me, hide me; I am Jesus
of Nazareth, I am flying from sinners who wish
to kill me, and who persecute me as Herod did: do
thou save me.”<a id="FNanchor_1447" href="#Footnote_1447" class="fnanchor">[1447]</a></p>

<h5>PRAYER.</h5>

<p>Then, oh Mary, even after thy Son hath died by
the hands of men who persecuted him unto death,
have not these ungrateful men yet ceased from persecuting
him with their sins, and continuing to afflict
thee, oh mother of sorrows? And I also, oh God,
have been one of these. Ah, my most sweet mother,
obtain for me tears to weep for such ingratitude.
And then, by the sufferings thou didst experience in
thy journey to Egypt, assist me in the journey that I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_552"></a>[552]</span>
am making to eternity, that at length I may go to
unite with thee in loving my persecuted Saviour, in
the country of the blessed. Amen.</p>

<h4 id="DOLOR_III">ON THE THIRD DOLOR.<br>
OF THE LOSS OF JESUS IN THE TEMPLE.</h4>

<p>St. James the Apostle has said, that our perfection
consists in the virtue of patience. “And patience
hath a perfect work, that you may be perfect and
entire, failing in nothing.”<a id="FNanchor_1448" href="#Footnote_1448" class="fnanchor">[1448]</a> The Lord having then
given us the Virgin Mary as an example of perfection,
it was necessary that she should be laden with sorrows,
that in her we might admire and imitate her heroic
patience. The dolor that we are this day to consider
is one of the greatest which our divine mother
suffered during her life, namely, the loss of her Son
in the temple. He who is born blind is little sensible
of the pain of being deprived of the light of day; but
to him who has once had sight and enjoyed the light,
it is a great sorrow to find himself deprived of it by
blindness. And thus it is with those unhappy souls
who, being blinded by the mire of this earth, have but
little knowledge of God, and therefore scarcely feel
pain at not finding him. On the contrary, the man
who, illuminated with celestial light, has been made
worthy to find by love the sweet presence of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_553"></a>[553]</span>
highest good, oh God, how he mourns when he finds
himself deprived of it! From this we can judge how
painful must have been to Mary, who was accustomed
to enjoy constantly the sweet presence of Jesus, that
third sword which wounded her, when she lost him in
Jerusalem, and was separated from him for three days.</p>

<p>In the second chapter of St. Luke we read that
the blessed Virgin, being accustomed to visit the temple
every year at the paschal season, with Joseph her
spouse and Jesus, once went when he was about
twelve years old, and Jesus remained in Jerusalem,
though she was not aware of it, for she thought he
was in company with others. When she reached
Nazareth she inquired for her Son, and not finding
him there, she returned immediately to Jerusalem to
seek him, but did not succeed until after three days.
Now let us imagine what distress that afflicted mother
must have experienced in those three days in which
she was searching everywhere for her Son, with the
spouse in the Canticles: “Have you seen him whom
my soul loveth?”<a id="FNanchor_1449" href="#Footnote_1449" class="fnanchor">[1449]</a> But she could hear no tidings of
him. Oh, with how much greater tenderness must
Mary, overcome with fatigue, and yet not having
found her beloved Son, have repeated those words of
Ruben, concerning his brother Joseph: The boy doth
not appear, and whither shall I go? “Puer non comparet,
et ego quo ibo?” My Jesus doth not appear,
and I know not what to do that I may find him; but
where shall I go without my treasure? Weeping<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_554"></a>[554]</span>
continually, she repeated during these three days with
David: “My tears have been my bread day and night,
whilst it is said to me daily, Where is thy God?”<a id="FNanchor_1450" href="#Footnote_1450" class="fnanchor">[1450]</a>
Wherefore Pelbart with reason says, that during those
nights the afflicted mother had no rest, but wept and
prayed without ceasing to God, that he would enable
her to find her Son.<a id="FNanchor_1451" href="#Footnote_1451" class="fnanchor">[1451]</a> And, according to St. Bernard,
often during that time did she repeat to her Son himself
the words of the spouse: “Show me where thou
feedest, where thou liest in the mid-day, lest I begin
to wander.”<a id="FNanchor_1452" href="#Footnote_1452" class="fnanchor">[1452]</a> My Son, tell me where thou art, that
I may no longer wander, seeking thee in vain.</p>

<p>Some writers assert, and not without reason, that
this dolor was not only one of the greatest, but that it
was the greatest and most painful of all. For in the
first place, Mary in her other dolors had Jesus with
her; she suffered when St. Simeon uttered the prophecy
in the temple; she suffered in the flight to Egypt,
but always with Jesus; but in this dolor she suffered
at a distance from Jesus, without knowing where he
was: “And the light of my eyes itself is not with
me.”<a id="FNanchor_1453" href="#Footnote_1453" class="fnanchor">[1453]</a> Thus, with tears, she then exclaimed: Ah,
the light of my eyes, my dear Jesus, is no more with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_555"></a>[555]</span>
me; he is far from me, I know not where he is! Origen
says, that through the love which this holy mother
bore her Son, she suffered more at this loss of Jesus
than any martyr ever suffered at death.<a id="FNanchor_1454" href="#Footnote_1454" class="fnanchor">[1454]</a> Ah, how
long were these three days for Mary! they appeared
three ages. Very bitter days, for there was none to
comfort her. And who, she exclaimed with Jeremias,
who can console me if he who could console me is far
from me? and therefore my eyes are not satisfied with
weeping: “Therefore do I weep, and my eyes run
down with water, because the comforter is far from
me.”<a id="FNanchor_1455" href="#Footnote_1455" class="fnanchor">[1455]</a> And with Tobias she repeated: “What manner
of joy shall be to me who sit in darkness, and see
not the light of heaven?”<a id="FNanchor_1456" href="#Footnote_1456" class="fnanchor">[1456]</a></p>

<p><i>Secondly.</i>—Mary well understood the cause and
end of the other dolors, namely, the redemption of
the world, the divine will; but in this she did not
know the cause of the absence of her Son. The sorrowful
mother was grieved to find Jesus withdrawn
from her, for her humility, says Lanspergius, made her
consider herself unworthy to remain with him any longer,
and attend upon him on earth, and have the care
of such a treasure.<a id="FNanchor_1457" href="#Footnote_1457" class="fnanchor">[1457]</a> And perhaps, she may have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_556"></a>[556]</span>
thought within herself, I have not served him as I
ought. Perhaps I have been guilty of some neglect,
and therefore he has left me. They sought him, lest
he perchance had left them, as Origen has said.<a id="FNanchor_1458" href="#Footnote_1458" class="fnanchor">[1458]</a>
Certainly there is no greater grief for a soul that loves
God than the fear of having displeased him. And
therefore Mary never complained in any other sorrow
but this, lovingly expostulating with Jesus after she
found him: “Son, why hast thou done so to us?
Thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing.”<a id="FNanchor_1459" href="#Footnote_1459" class="fnanchor">[1459]</a> By
these words she did not wish to reprove Jesus, as the
heretics blasphemously assert, but only to make known
to him the grief she had experienced during his absence
from her, on account of the love she bore him.
It was not a rebuke, says blessed Denis the Carthusian,
but a loving complaint: “Non erat increpatio,
sed amorosa conquestio.” Finally, this sword so cruelly
pierced the heart of the Virgin, that the blessed
Benvenuta, desiring one day to share the pain of the
holy mother in this dolor, and praying her to obtain
for her this grace, Mary appeared to her with the infant
Jesus in her arms; but while Benvenuta was enjoying
the sight of that most beautiful child, in one moment
she was deprived of it. So great was her sorrow that
she had recourse to Mary, to implore her pity that it
should not make her die of grief. The holy Virgin<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_557"></a>[557]</span>
appeared to her again three days after, and said to
her: “Now learn, oh my daughter, that thy sorrow is
but a small part of that which I suffered when I lost
my Son.”<a id="FNanchor_1460" href="#Footnote_1460" class="fnanchor">[1460]</a></p>

<p>This sorrow of Mary ought, in the first place, to
serve as a comfort to those souls who are desolate and
do not enjoy the sweet presence they once enjoyed of
their Lord. They may weep, but let them weep in
peace, as Mary wept the absence of her Son. Let
them take courage, and not fear that on this account
they have lost the divine favor, for God himself said
to St. Theresa: “No one is lost without knowing it;
and no one is deceived without wishing to be deceived.”
If the Lord departs from the sight of that soul who
loves him, he does not therefore depart from the
heart. He often hides himself that she may seek him
with greater desire and love. But those who would
find Jesus must seek him, not amid the delights and
pleasures of the world, but amid crosses and mortifications,
as Mary sought him: We sought thee sorrowing,
as she said to her Son: “Dolentes quærebamus te.”
Learn from Mary to seek Jesus, says Origen: “Disce
a Maria quærere Jesum.”</p>

<p>Moreover, in this world we should seek no other
good than Jesus. Job was not unhappy when he
lost all that he possessed on earth; riches, children,
health, and honors, and even descended from a throne
to a dunghill; but because he had God with him, even
then he was happy. St. Augustine, speaking of him,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_558"></a>[558]</span>
says: He had lost all that God had given him, but he
had God himself: “Perdiderat illa quæ dederat Deus,
sed habebat ipsum Deum.” Unhappy and truly
wretched are those souls who have lost God. If Mary
wept for the absence of her Son for three days, how
ought sinners to weep who have lost divine grace, to
whom God says: “You are not my people, and I will
not be yours.”<a id="FNanchor_1461" href="#Footnote_1461" class="fnanchor">[1461]</a> For sin does this, namely, it separates
the soul from God: “Your iniquities have divided between
you and your God.”<a id="FNanchor_1462" href="#Footnote_1462" class="fnanchor">[1462]</a> Hence, if even sinners
possess all the goods of earth and have lost God,
every thing on earth becomes vanity and affliction to
them, as Solomon confessed: “Behold, all is vanity
and vexation of spirit.”<a id="FNanchor_1463" href="#Footnote_1463" class="fnanchor">[1463]</a> But as St. Augustine says:
The greatest misfortune of these poor blind souls is,
that if they lose an ox, they do not fail to go in search
of it; if they lose a sheep, they use all diligence to
find it; if they lose a beast of burden, they cannot
rest; but they lose the highest good, which is God,
and yet they eat and drink, and take their rest.<a id="FNanchor_1464" href="#Footnote_1464" class="fnanchor">[1464]</a></p>

<h5>EXAMPLE.</h5>

<p>We read in the Annual Letters of the Society of
Jesus, that in India, a young man who was just leaving<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_559"></a>[559]</span>
his apartment in order to commit sin heard a voice,
saying: “Stop, where are you going?” He turned
round and saw an image, in relief, of the sorrowful
Mary, who drew out the sword which was in her
breast, and said to him: “Take this dagger and pierce
my heart rather than wound my Son with this sin.”
At the sound of these words the youth prostrated
himself on the ground, and with deep contrition, bursting
into tears, he asked and obtained from God and
the Virgin pardon of his sin.</p>

<h5>PRAYER.</h5>

<p>Oh blessed Virgin, why art thou afflicted, seeking
thy lost Son? Is it because thou dost not know
where he is? But dost thou not know that he is in
thy heart? Dost thou not see that he is feeding
among the lilies? Thou thyself hast said it: “My
beloved to me and I to him who feedeth among the
lilies.”<a id="FNanchor_1465" href="#Footnote_1465" class="fnanchor">[1465]</a> These, thy humble, pure, and holy thoughts
and affections, are all lilies, that invite the divine
spouse to dwell with thee. Ah, Mary, dost thou sigh
after Jesus, thou who lovest none but Jesus? Leave
sighing to me and so many other sinners who do not
love him, and who have lost him by offending him.
My most amiable mother, if through my fault thy Son
has not yet returned to my soul, wilt thou obtain for
me that I may find him. I know well that he allows
himself to be found by all who seek him: The Lord<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_560"></a>[560]</span>
is good to the soul that seeketh him: “Bonus est
Dominus ... animæ quærenti illum.”<a id="FNanchor_1466" href="#Footnote_1466" class="fnanchor">[1466]</a> Make me to
seek him as I ought to seek him. Thou art the gate
through which all find Jesus; through thee I too hope
to find him.</p>

<h4 id="DOLOR_IV">ON THE FOURTH DOLOR.<br>
OF THE MEETING OF MARY WITH JESUS, WHEN HE WENT TO DEATH.</h4>

<p>St. Bernardine says, that to form an idea of the
grief of Mary in losing her Jesus by death, it is necessary
to consider the love that this mother bore to this
her Son. All mothers feel the sufferings of their
children as their own. Hence the woman of Chanaan,
when she prayed the Saviour to deliver her daughter
from the devil that tormented her, said to him, that
he should have pity on the mother rather than on the
daughter: “Have mercy on me, oh Lord, thou son
of David, my daughter is grievously troubled by a
devil.”<a id="FNanchor_1467" href="#Footnote_1467" class="fnanchor">[1467]</a> But what mother ever loved a child so much
as Mary loved Jesus? He was her only child, reared
amidst so many troubles and pains; a most amiable
child, and most loving to his mother; a Son, who was
at the same time her Son and her God; who came
on earth to kindle in the hearts of all the holy fire of
divine love, as he himself declared: “I am come to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_561"></a>[561]</span>
cast fire on the earth, and what will I but that it be
kindled?”<a id="FNanchor_1468" href="#Footnote_1468" class="fnanchor">[1468]</a> Let us consider how he must have inflamed
that pure heart of his holy mother, so free
from every earthly affection. In a word, the blessed
Virgin herself said to St. Bridget, that through love
her heart and the heart of her Son was one: “Unum
erat cor meum, et cor filii mei.” That blending of
handmaid and mother, of Son and God, kindled in
the heart of Mary a fire composed of a thousand
flames. But afterwards, at the time of the passion,
this flame of love was changed into a sea of sorrow.
Hence St. Bernardine says: All the sorrows of the
world united would not be equal to the sorrow of the
glorious Mary.<a id="FNanchor_1469" href="#Footnote_1469" class="fnanchor">[1469]</a> Yes, because this mother, as St.
Lawrence Justinian writes: The more tenderly she
loved, was the more deeply wounded.<a id="FNanchor_1470" href="#Footnote_1470" class="fnanchor">[1470]</a> The greater
the tenderness with which she loved him, the greater
was her grief at the sight of his sufferings, especially
when she met her Son, after he had already been
condemned, going to death at the place of punishment,
bearing the cross. And this is the fourth sword
of sorrow which to-day we have to consider.</p>

<p>The blessed Virgin revealed to St. Bridget, that at
the time when the passion of our Lord was drawing
nigh, her eyes were always filled with tears, as she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_562"></a>[562]</span>
thought of her beloved Son whom she was about to
lose on this earth. Therefore, as she also said, a cold
sweat covered her body from the fear that seized her
at that prospect of approaching suffering.<a id="FNanchor_1471" href="#Footnote_1471" class="fnanchor">[1471]</a> Behold,
the appointed day at length arrived, and Jesus came
in tears to take leave of his mother before he went to
death. St. Bonaventure, contemplating Mary on that
night, says: Thou didst spend it without sleep, and
while others slept, thou didst remain watching.<a id="FNanchor_1472" href="#Footnote_1472" class="fnanchor">[1472]</a>
Morning having arrived, the disciples of Jesus Christ
came to this afflicted mother, one, to bring her this
tidings, another, that; but all tidings of sorrow, for in
her were then verified the words of Jeremias: “Weeping,
she hath wept in the night, and her tears are on
her cheeks; there is none to comfort her of all them
that were dear to her.”<a id="FNanchor_1473" href="#Footnote_1473" class="fnanchor">[1473]</a> One came to relate to her
the cruel treatment of her Son in the house of Caiphas;
another, the insults received by him from Herod.
Finally, for I omit all the rest to come to my point,
St. John came, and announced to Mary that the most
unjust Pilate had already condemned him to death
upon the cross. I say the most unjust, for, as St. Leo
remarks, this unjust judge condemned him to death
with the same lips with which he had pronounced<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_563"></a>[563]</span>
him innocent.<a id="FNanchor_1474" href="#Footnote_1474" class="fnanchor">[1474]</a> Ah, sorrowful mother, said St. John
to her, thy Son has already been condemned to death,
he is already on his way, bearing himself his cross on
his way to Calvary, as he afterwards related in his
Gospel: “And bearing his own cross, he went forth to
that place which is called Calvary.”<a id="FNanchor_1475" href="#Footnote_1475" class="fnanchor">[1475]</a> Come, if thou
dost desire to see him, and bid him a last farewell in
some of the streets through which he is to pass.</p>

<p>Mary goes with St. John, and she perceives by the
blood with which the way was sprinkled, that her Son
had already passed there. This she revealed to St.
Bridget: “By the footsteps of my Son I traced his
course, for along the way by which he had passed, the
ground was sprinkled with blood.”<a id="FNanchor_1476" href="#Footnote_1476" class="fnanchor">[1476]</a> St. Bonaventure
imagines the afflicted mother taking a shorter way,
and placing herself at the corner of the street to meet
her afflicted Son as he passed by.<a id="FNanchor_1477" href="#Footnote_1477" class="fnanchor">[1477]</a> This most afflicted
mother met her most afflicted Son: Mœstissima
mater mœstissimo filio occurrit, said St. Bernard.
While Mary stopped in that place how much she must
have heard said against her Son by the Jews, who
knew her, and perhaps also words in mockery of herself!
Alas! what a commencement of sorrows was
then before her eyes, when she saw the nails, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_564"></a>[564]</span>
hammers, the cords, the fatal instruments of the death
of her Son borne before him! And what a sword
pierced her heart when, she heard the trumpet proclaiming
along the way the sentence pronounced
against her Son! But behold, now, after the instruments,
the trumpet, and the ministers of justice had
passed, she raises her eyes and sees; she sees, oh God,
a young man covered with blood and wounds from head
to foot, with a crown of thorns on his head, and two
heavy beams on his shoulders; she looks at him and
hardly knows him, saying, then, with Isaias: “And
we have seen him, and there was no sightliness.”<a id="FNanchor_1478" href="#Footnote_1478" class="fnanchor">[1478]</a>
Yes, for the wounds, the bruises, and clotted blood,
made him look like a leper: “We have thought him,
as it were, a leper;”<a id="FNanchor_1479" href="#Footnote_1479" class="fnanchor">[1479]</a> so that he could no longer be
recognized. “And his look was, as it were, hidden and
despised, whereupon we esteemed him not.”<a id="FNanchor_1480" href="#Footnote_1480" class="fnanchor">[1480]</a> But at
length love recognizes him, and as soon as she knows
him, ah, what was then, as St. Peter of Alcantara
says in his meditations, the love and fear of the heart
of Mary! On the one hand, she desired to see him;
on the other, she could not endure to look upon so
pitiable a sight. But at length they look at each
other. The Son wipes from his eyes the clotted
blood, which prevented him from seeing (as was revealed
to St. Bridget), and looks upon the mother;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_565"></a>[565]</span>
the mother looks upon the Son. Ah, looks of sorrow,
which pierced, as with so many arrows, those two
holy and loving souls. When Margaret, the daughter
of Sir Thomas More, met her father on his way to the
scaffold, she could utter only two words, oh, father!
oh, father! and fell fainting at his feet. At the sight
of her Son going to Calvary, Mary fainted not; no,
because it was not fitting that this mother should lose
the use of her reason, as Father Suarez remarks, neither
did she die, for God reserved her for a greater grief;
but if she did not die, she suffered sorrow enough to
cause her a thousand deaths.</p>

<p>The mother wished to embrace him, as St. Anselm
says, but the officers of justice thrust her aside, loading
her with insults, and urge onward our afflicted
Lord. Mary follows. Ah, holy Virgin, where art
thou going? To Calvary! And canst thou trust
thyself to see him who is thy life hanging from a
cross? And thy life shall be as it were hanging before
thee: “Et erit vita tua quasi pendens ante te.”<a id="FNanchor_1481" href="#Footnote_1481" class="fnanchor">[1481]</a>
Ah! my mother, stop, says St. Lawrence Justinian,
as if the Son himself had then spoken to her; where
dost thou hasten? Where art thou going? If thou
comest where I go, thou wilt be tortured with my
sufferings, and I with thine.<a id="FNanchor_1482" href="#Footnote_1482" class="fnanchor">[1482]</a> But although the sight
of her dying Jesus must cost her such cruel anguish,
the loving Mary will not leave him. The Son goes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_566"></a>[566]</span>
before, and the mother follows, that she may be crucified
with her Son, as William the Abbot says: The
mother took up her cross, and followed him, that she
might be crucified with him.<a id="FNanchor_1483" href="#Footnote_1483" class="fnanchor">[1483]</a> We even pity the wild
beasts: “Ferarum etiam miseremur;” St. John
Chrysostom has said. If we should see a lioness following
her whelp as he was led to death, even this
wild beast would call forth our compassion. And
shall we not feel compassion to see Mary following her
immaculate Lamb, as they are leading him to death?
Let us then pity her, and endeavor also ourselves to
accompany her Son and herself, bearing with patience
the cross which the Lord imposes on us. Why did
Jesus Christ, asks St. John Chrysostom, desire to be
alone in his other sufferings, but in bearing the cross
wished to be helped by the Cyrenean? And he
answers: That thou mayest understand that the cross
of Christ is not sufficient without thine.<a id="FNanchor_1484" href="#Footnote_1484" class="fnanchor">[1484]</a> The cross
alone of Jesus is not enough to save us, if we do not
bear with resignation also our own, even unto death.</p>

<h5>EXAMPLE.</h5>

<p>The Saviour appeared one day to sister Diomira, a
nun, in Florence, and said to her: “Think of me, and
love me, and I will think of thee, and love thee” and
at the same time he presented her with a bunch of
flowers and a cross, signifying to her by this, that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_567"></a>[567]</span>
consolations of the saints on this earth are always to
be accompanied by the cross. The cross unites souls
to God. Blessed Jerome Emilian, when he was a
soldier, and leading a very sinful life, was shut up by
his enemies in a tower. There, feeling deeply his misfortune,
and enlightened by God to amend his life,
he had recourse to the most holy Mary, and then with
the help of this divine mother, he began to live the
life of a saint. By this he merited to see once in
heaven the high place which God had prepared for
him. He became founder of the order of Sommaschi,
died a saint, and has been lately beatified by the holy
Church.</p>

<h5>PRAYER.</h5>

<p>My sorrowful mother, by the merit of that grief
which thou didst feel at seeing thy beloved Jesus led
to death, obtain for me the grace also to bear with
patience those crosses which God sends me. Happy
me, if I also shall know how to accompany thee with
my cross until death. Thou and Jesus, both innocent,
have borne a heavy cross; and shall I a sinner, who
have merited hell, refuse mine? Ah, immaculate
Virgin, I hope that thou wilt help me to bear my
crosses with patience. Amen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_568"></a>[568]</span></p>

<h4 id="DOLOR_V">ON THE FIFTH DOLOR.<br>
OF THE DEATH OF JESUS.</h4>

<p>And now we have to admire a new sort of martyrdom,
a mother condemned to see an innocent son,
whom she loved with all the affection of her heart,
put to death before her eyes, by the most barbarous
tortures. There stood by the cross of Jesus his
mother: “Stabat autem juxta crucem mater ejus.”
There is nothing more to be said, says St. John, of
the martyrdom of Mary: behold her at the foot of
the cross, looking on her dying Son, and then see if
there is grief like her grief. Let us stop then also
to-day on Calvary, to consider this fifth sword that
pierced the heart of Mary, namely, the death of
Jesus.</p>

<p>As soon as our afflicted Redeemer had ascended the
hill of Calvary, the executioners stripped him of his
garments, and piercing his sacred hands and feet with
nails, not sharp, but blunt: “Non acutis, sed obtusis;”
as St. Bernard says,<a id="FNanchor_1485" href="#Footnote_1485" class="fnanchor">[1485]</a> and to torture him more, they
fastened him to the cross. When they had crucified
him, they planted the cross, and thus left him to die.
The executioners abandon him, but Mary does not abandon
him. She then draws nearer to the cross, in order
to assist at his death. “I did not leave him,” thus
the blessed Virgin revealed to St. Bridget, “and stood<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_569"></a>[569]</span>
nearer to his cross.”<a id="FNanchor_1486" href="#Footnote_1486" class="fnanchor">[1486]</a> But what did it avail, oh Lady,
says St. Bonaventure, to go to Calvary to witness there
the death of this Son? Shame should have prevented
thee, for his disgrace was also thine, because thou
wast his mother; or, at least, the horror of such a
crime as that of seeing a God crucified by his own
creatures, should have prevented thee.<a id="FNanchor_1487" href="#Footnote_1487" class="fnanchor">[1487]</a> But the saint
himself answers: Thy heart did not consider the horror,
but the suffering: “Non considerabat cor tuum horrorem,
sed dolorem.” Ah, thy heart did not then
care for its own sorrow, but for the suffering and death
of thy dear Son; and therefore thou thyself didst
wish to be near him, at least to compassionate him.
Ah, true mother! says William the Abbot, loving
mother! for not even the terror of death could separate
thee from thy beloved Son.<a id="FNanchor_1488" href="#Footnote_1488" class="fnanchor">[1488]</a> But, oh God, what
a spectacle of sorrow, to see this Son then in agony
upon the cross, and under the cross this mother in
agony, who was suffering all the pain that her Son
was suffering! Behold the words in which Mary revealed
to St. Bridget the pitiable state of her dying
Son, as she saw him on the cross: “My dear Jesus
was on the cross in grief and in agony; his eyes were
sunken, half closed, and lifeless; the lips hanging, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_570"></a>[570]</span>
the mouth open; the cheeks hollow, and attached to
the teeth; the face lengthened, the nose sharp, the
countenance sad; the head had fallen upon his breast,
the hair black with blood, the stomach collapsed, the
arms and legs stiff, and the whole body covered with
wounds and blood.”<a id="FNanchor_1489" href="#Footnote_1489" class="fnanchor">[1489]</a></p>

<p>Mary also suffered all these pains of Jesus. Every
torture inflicted on the body of Jesus, says St. Jerome,
was a wound in the heart of the mother.<a id="FNanchor_1490" href="#Footnote_1490" class="fnanchor">[1490]</a> Any one
of us who should then have been on Mount Calvary,
would have seen two altars, says St. John Chrysostom,
on which two great sacrifices were consummating,
one in the body of Jesus, the other in the heart of
Mary. But rather would I see there, with St. Bonaventure,
one altar only, namely, the cross alone of the
Son, on which, with the victim, this divine Lamb, the
mother also was sacrificed. Therefore the saint interrogates
her in these words: Oh Lady, where art
thou? Near the cross? Nay, on the cross, thou art
crucified with thy Son.<a id="FNanchor_1491" href="#Footnote_1491" class="fnanchor">[1491]</a> St. Augustine also says the
same thing: The cross and nails of the Son were
also the cross and nails of the mother; Christ being
crucified, the mother was also crucified.<a id="FNanchor_1492" href="#Footnote_1492" class="fnanchor">[1492]</a> Yes, because,
as St. Bernard says, love inflicted on the heart<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_571"></a>[571]</span>
of Mary the same suffering that the nails caused in
the body of Jesus.<a id="FNanchor_1493" href="#Footnote_1493" class="fnanchor">[1493]</a> Therefore, at the same time that
the Son was sacrificing his body, the mother, as St.
Bernardine says, was sacrificing her soul.<a id="FNanchor_1494" href="#Footnote_1494" class="fnanchor">[1494]</a></p>

<p>Mothers fly from the presence of their dying children;
but if a mother is ever obliged to witness the
death of a child, she procures for him all possible
relief; she arranges the bed, that his posture may be
more easy; she administers refreshments to him; and
thus the poor mother relieves her own sorrows. Ah,
mother, the most afflicted of all mothers! oh Mary,
it was decreed that thou shouldst be present at the
death of Jesus, but it was not given to thee to afford
him any relief. Mary heard her Son say: I thirst:
“Sitio;” but it was not permitted her to give him a
little water to quench his great thirst. She could
only say to him, as St. Vincent Ferrer remarks: My
Son, I have only the water of my tears: “Fili, non
habeo nisi aquam lacrymarum.”<a id="FNanchor_1495" href="#Footnote_1495" class="fnanchor">[1495]</a> She saw that her
Son, suspended by three nails to that bed of sorrow,
could find no rest. She wished to clasp him to her
heart, that she might give him relief, or at least that
he might expire in her arms, but she could not.<a id="FNanchor_1496" href="#Footnote_1496" class="fnanchor">[1496]</a> She
saw that poor Son in a sea of sorrow, seeking one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_572"></a>[572]</span>
who could console him, as he had predicted by the
mouth of the prophet: “I have trodden the wine-press
alone; I looked about and there was none to
help; I sought and there was none to give aid.”<a id="FNanchor_1497" href="#Footnote_1497" class="fnanchor">[1497]</a>
But who was there among men to console him, if all
were his enemies? Even on the cross they cursed
and mocked him on every side: “And they that passed
by blasphemed him, wagging their heads.”<a id="FNanchor_1498" href="#Footnote_1498" class="fnanchor">[1498]</a> Some
said to him: “If thou be the Son of God, come down
from the cross.”<a id="FNanchor_1499" href="#Footnote_1499" class="fnanchor">[1499]</a> Some exclaimed: “He saved others,
himself he cannot save.”<a id="FNanchor_1500" href="#Footnote_1500" class="fnanchor">[1500]</a> Others said: “If he be
the King of Israel, let him now come down from the
cross.”<a id="FNanchor_1501" href="#Footnote_1501" class="fnanchor">[1501]</a> The blessed Virgin herself said to St.
Bridget: “I heard some call my Son a thief; I heard
others call him an impostor; others said that no one
deserved death more than he; and every word was to
me a new sword of sorrow.”<a id="FNanchor_1502" href="#Footnote_1502" class="fnanchor">[1502]</a></p>

<p>But what increased most the sorrows which Mary
suffered through compassion for her Son, was to hear
him complain on the cross that even the eternal Father
had abandoned him: “My God, my God, why hast
thou forsaken me?”<a id="FNanchor_1503" href="#Footnote_1503" class="fnanchor">[1503]</a> Words which, as the divine<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_573"></a>[573]</span>
mother herself said to St. Bridget, could never depart
from her mind during her whole life.<a id="FNanchor_1504" href="#Footnote_1504" class="fnanchor">[1504]</a> Thus the afflicted
mother saw her Jesus suffering on every side;
she desired to comfort him, but could not. And what
caused her the greatest sorrow was to see that, by her
presence and her grief, she increased the sufferings of
her Son. The sorrow itself, says St. Bernard, that
filled the heart of Mary, increased the bitterness of
sorrow in the heart of Jesus.<a id="FNanchor_1505" href="#Footnote_1505" class="fnanchor">[1505]</a> St. Bernard also says,
that Jesus on the cross suffered more from compassion
for his mother than from his own pains: he thus
speaks in the name of the Virgin: I stood and looked
upon him, and he looked upon me; and he suffered
more for me than for himself.<a id="FNanchor_1506" href="#Footnote_1506" class="fnanchor">[1506]</a> The same saint also,
speaking of Mary beside her dying Son, says, that she
lived dying without being able to die: Near the cross
stood his mother, speechless; living she died, dying
she lived; neither could she die, because she was
dead, being yet alive.<a id="FNanchor_1507" href="#Footnote_1507" class="fnanchor">[1507]</a> Passino writes that Jesus
Christ himself, speaking one day to the blessed Baptista
Varana, of Camerino, said to her, that he was so
afflicted on the cross at the sight of his mother in such
anguish at his feet, that compassion for his mother<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_574"></a>[574]</span>
caused him to die without consolation. So that the
blessed Baptista, being enlightened to know this suffering
of Jesus, exclaimed: Oh my Lord, tell me no more
of this thy sorrow, for I cannot bear it.</p>

<p>Men were astonished, says Simon of Cassia, when
they saw this mother then keep silence, without uttering
a complaint in this great suffering.<a id="FNanchor_1508" href="#Footnote_1508" class="fnanchor">[1508]</a> But if the
lips of Mary were silent, her heart was not so; for she
did not cease offering to divine justice the life of her
Son for our salvation. Therefore we know that by
the merits of her dolors she co-operated with Christ
in bringing us forth to the life of grace, and therefore
we are children of her sorrows: Christ, says Lanspergius,
wished her whom he had appointed for our
mother to co-operate with him in our redemption; for
she herself at the foot of the cross was to bring us
forth as her children.<a id="FNanchor_1509" href="#Footnote_1509" class="fnanchor">[1509]</a> And if ever any consolation
entered into that sea of bitterness, namely, the heart
of Mary, it was this only one; namely, the knowledge
that by means of her sorrows, she was bringing us to
eternal salvation; as Jesus himself revealed to St.
Bridget: “My mother Mary, on account of her compassion
and charity, was made mother of all in heaven
and on earth.”<a id="FNanchor_1510" href="#Footnote_1510" class="fnanchor">[1510]</a> And, indeed, these were the last<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_575"></a>[575]</span>
words with which Jesus took leave of her before his
death; this was his last remembrance, leaving us to
her for her children in the person of John, when he
said to her: Woman, behold thy Son: “Mulier ecce
filius tuus.”<a id="FNanchor_1511" href="#Footnote_1511" class="fnanchor">[1511]</a> And from that time Mary began to
perform for us this office of a good mother; for, as
St. Peter Damian declares, the penitent thief, through
the prayers of Mary, was then converted and saved:
Therefore the good thief repented, because the blessed
Virgin, standing between the cross of her Son and that
of the thief, prayed her Son for him; thus rewarding,
by this favor, his former service.<a id="FNanchor_1512" href="#Footnote_1512" class="fnanchor">[1512]</a> For as other authors
also relate, this thief, in the journey to Egypt
with the infant Jesus, showed them kindness; and
this same office the blessed Virgin has ever continued,
and still continues to perform.</p>

<h5>EXAMPLE.</h5>

<p>A young man in Perugia once promised the devil
that if he would help him to commit a sinful act which
he desired to do, he would give him his soul; and he
gave him a writing to that effect, signed with his
blood. The evil deed was committed, and the devil
demanded the performance of the promise. He led
the young man to a well, and threatened to take him<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_576"></a>[576]</span>
body and soul to hell if he would not cast himself into
it. The wretched youth, thinking that it would be
impossible for him to escape from his enemy, climbed
the well-side in order to cast himself into it, but terrified
at the thought of death, he said to the devil that
he had not the courage to throw himself in, and that,
if he wished to see him dead, he himself should thrust
him in. The young man wore about his neck the
scapular of the sorrowing Mary; and the devil said
to him: “Take off that scapular, and I will thrust
you in.” But the youth, seeing the protection which
the divine mother still gave him through that scapular,
refused to take it off, and after a great deal
of altercation, the devil departed in confusion. The
sinner repented, and grateful to his sorrowful mother,
went to thank her, and presented a picture of this
case, as an offering, at her altar in the new church of
Santa Maria, in Perugia.<a id="FNanchor_1513" href="#Footnote_1513" class="fnanchor">[1513]</a></p>

<h5>PRAYER.</h5>

<p>Ah, mother, the most afflicted of all mothers, thy
Son, then, is dead; thy Son so amiable, and who
loved thee so much! Weep, for thou hast reason to
weep. Who can ever console thee? Nothing can
console thee but the thought that Jesus, by his death,
hath conquered hell, hath opened paradise, which was
closed to men, and hath gained so many souls. From
that throne of the cross he was to reign over so many
hearts, which, conquered by his love, would serve him<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_577"></a>[577]</span>
with love. Do not disdain, oh my mother, to keep
me near to weep with thee, for I have more reason
than thou to weep for the offences that I have committed
against thy Son. Ah, mother of mercy, I hope
for pardon and my eternal salvation, first through the
death of my Redeemer, and then through the merits
of thy dolors. Amen.</p>

<h4 id="DOLOR_VI">ON THE SIXTH DOLOR.<br>
THE PIERCING OF THE SIDE OF JESUS, AND HIS DESCENT FROM THE CROSS.</h4>

<p>“Oh, all ye that pass by the way attend, and see
if there be any sorrow like to my sorrow.”<a id="FNanchor_1514" href="#Footnote_1514" class="fnanchor">[1514]</a> Devout
souls, listen to what the sorrowful Mary says to you
to-day: My beloved children, I do not wish you to
console me; no, for my heart can never again be consoled
on this earth after the death of my dear Jesus. If
you wish to please me, this I ask of you, turn to me
and see if there has ever been in the world a grief like
mine, when I saw him who was all my love torn from
me so cruelly. But, oh Lady, since thou dost not
wish to be consoled, and hast such a thirst for suffering,
I must say to thee that thy sorrows have not
ended with the death of thy Son. To-day thou wilt
be pierced by another sword of sorrow, when thou
shalt see a cruel lance piercing the side of this thy Son,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_578"></a>[578]</span>
already dead, and shalt receive him in thy arms after
he is taken from the cross. And now we are to consider
to-day the sixth dolor which afflicted this sorrowful
mother. Attend and weep. Hitherto the
dolors of Mary tortured her one by one, but to-day
they are all united to assail her.</p>

<p>To make known to a mother that her child is dead,
is sufficient to kindle her whole soul with love for the
lost one. Some persons, in order to lighten their
grief, will remind mothers whose children have died,
of the displeasure they have once caused them. But
if I, oh my queen, should wish to lighten thy sorrow
for the death of Jesus in this way, what displeasure
has he ever caused thee, that I could recall to thy
mind? Ah, no; he always loved thee, obeyed thee,
and respected thee. Now thou hast lost him, and
who can describe thy sorrow? Do thou who hast
felt it explain it. A devout author says, that when
our Redeemer was dead, the heart of the great mother
was first engaged in accompanying the most holy soul
of the Son, and presenting it to the eternal Father.
I present thee, oh my God, Mary must then have
said, the immaculate soul of thy and my Son, which
has been obedient to thee even unto death: receive it,
then, in thy arms. Thy justice is now satisfied, thy
will accomplished; behold, the great sacrifice to thy
eternal glory is consummated. And then turning to
the lifeless members of her Jesus: Oh wounds, she
said, oh loving wounds, I adore you, I rejoice with
you, since through you salvation has been given to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_579"></a>[579]</span>
the world. You shall remain open in the body of my
Son, to be the refuge of those who will have recourse
to you. Oh how many, through you, shall receive
the pardon of their sins, and then through you shall
be inflamed to love the Sovereign Good!</p>

<p>That the joy of the following Paschal Sabbath
should not be disturbed, the Jews wished the body of
Jesus to be taken down from the cross; but because
they could not take down a criminal until he was
dead, they came with iron mallets to break his legs,
as they had already done to the two thieves crucified
with him. And Mary, while she remains weeping at
the death of her Son, sees those armed men coming
towards her Jesus. At this sight she first trembled
with fear, then she said: Ah, my Son is already dead,
cease to maltreat him, and cease to torture me a poor
mother longer. She implored them not to break his
legs: “Oravit eos, ne frangerent crura,” as St. Bonaventure
writes. But while she is thus speaking, oh,
God! she sees a soldier with violence brandishing a
spear, and piercing the side of Jesus: “One of the
soldiers with a spear opened his side, and immediately
there came out blood and water.”<a id="FNanchor_1515" href="#Footnote_1515" class="fnanchor">[1515]</a> The cross shook
at the stroke of the spear, and, as was revealed to St.
Bridget, the heart of Jesus was divided: “Ita ut
ambæ partes essent divisæ.”<a id="FNanchor_1516" href="#Footnote_1516" class="fnanchor">[1516]</a> There came out blood
and water, for only a few drops of blood remained,
and those also the Saviour wished to shed, in order to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_580"></a>[580]</span>
show that he had no more blood to give us. The
injury of that stroke was offered to Jesus, but the
pain was inflicted on Mary: Christ, says the devout
Lanspergius, shared with his mother the infliction of
that wound, for he received the insult and his mother
the pain.<a id="FNanchor_1517" href="#Footnote_1517" class="fnanchor">[1517]</a> The holy Fathers explain this to be the
very sword predicted to the Virgin by St. Simeon; a
sword, not of iron, but of grief, which pierced through
her blessed soul in the heart of Jesus, where it always
dwelt. Thus, among others, St. Bernard says:
The spear which opened his side passed through the
soul of the Virgin, which could not be torn from the
heart of Jesus.<a id="FNanchor_1518" href="#Footnote_1518" class="fnanchor">[1518]</a> And the divine mother herself revealed
the same to St. Bridget, saying: “When the spear
was drawn out, the point appeared red with blood;
then I felt as if my heart were pierced when I saw
the heart of my most dear Son pierced.”<a id="FNanchor_1519" href="#Footnote_1519" class="fnanchor">[1519]</a> The angel
told St. Bridget, that such were the sufferings of
Mary, that she was saved from death only by the
miraculous power of God.<a id="FNanchor_1520" href="#Footnote_1520" class="fnanchor">[1520]</a> In her other dolors she
at least had her Son to compassionate her; and now
she had not even him to take pity on her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_581"></a>[581]</span></p>

<p>The afflicted mother, still fearing that other injuries
might be inflicted on her Son, entreats Joseph of
Arimathea to obtain from Pilate the body of her Jesus,
that at least after his death she may be able to
guard it and protect it from injuries. Joseph went to
Pilate, and made known to him the sorrow and the
wish of this afflicted mother; and St. Anselm thinks
that compassion for the mother softened the heart of
Pilate, and moved him to grant her the body of the
Saviour. And now Jesus is taken from the cross.
Oh most holy Virgin, after thou with so great love
hadst given thy Son to the world for our salvation,
behold the world returns him to thee again! But oh,
my God, how dost thou return him to me? said Mary
to the world. My Son was white and ruddy: “Dilectus
meus candidus et rubicundus:” but thou hast
returned him to me blackened with bruises, and red,
not with a ruddy color, but with the wounds thou
hast inflicted upon him; he was beautiful, now there
is no more beauty in him; he is all deformity. All
were enamored with his aspect, now he excites horror
in all who look upon him. Oh, how many swords,
says St. Bonaventure, pierced the soul of this mother,
when she received the body of her Son after it was
taken from the cross: “O quot gladii animam matris
pertransierunt!” Let us consider what anguish it
would cause any mother to receive the lifeless body
of a son! It was revealed to St. Bridget, that to
take down the body of Jesus, three ladders were
placed against the cross. Those holy disciples first<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_582"></a>[582]</span>
drew out the nails from the hands and feet, and according
to Metaphrastes, gave them in charge to
Mary. Then one supported the upper part of the
body of Jesus, the other the lower, and thus took it
down from the cross. Bernardine de Bustis describes
the afflicted mother as raising herself, and extending
her arms to meet her dear Son; she embraces him,
and then sits down at the foot of the cross. She sees
his mouth open, his eye shut, she examines the lacerated
flesh, and those exposed bones; she takes off the
crown, and sees the cruel injury made by those thorns,
in that sacred head; she looks upon those pierced
hands and feet, and says: Ah, my Son, to what has the
love thou didst bear to men reduced thee! But what
evil hast thou done to them, that they have treated
thee so cruelly? Thou wast my father, Bernardine
de Bustis imagines her to say, my brother, my spouse,
my delight, my glory, my all.<a id="FNanchor_1521" href="#Footnote_1521" class="fnanchor">[1521]</a> Oh, my Son, behold
how I am afflicted, look upon me and console me;
but thou dost look upon me no more. Speak, speak
to me but one word, and console me; but thou dost
speak no more, for thou art dead. Then turning to
those barbarous instruments, she said: Oh cruel thorns,
oh nails, oh merciless spear, how could you thus torture
your Creator? But what thorns, what nails?
Alas! sinners, she exclaimed, it is you who have thus
cruelly treated my Son.</p>

<p>Thus Mary spoke and complained of us. But if<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_583"></a>[583]</span>
now she were capable of suffering, what would she
say? What grief would she feel to see that men,
after the death of her Son, continue to torment and
crucify him by their sins! Let us no longer give
pain to this sorrowful mother; and if we also have
hitherto grieved her by our sins, let us now do what
she directs. She says to us: Return, ye transgressors,
to the heart: “Redite, prævaricatores, ad cor.”<a id="FNanchor_1522" href="#Footnote_1522" class="fnanchor">[1522]</a>
Sinners, return to the wounded heart of my Jesus;
return as penitents, for he will receive you. Flee from
him to him, she continues to say with Guerric the
Abbot; from the Judge to the Redeemer, from the
tribunal to the cross.<a id="FNanchor_1523" href="#Footnote_1523" class="fnanchor">[1523]</a> The Virgin herself revealed to
St. Bridget that she closed the eyes of her Son when
he was taken down from the cross, but she could not
close his arms: “Ejus brachia flectere non potui.”
Jesus Christ giving us to understand by this, that he
desired to remain with open arms to receive all penitent
sinners who return to him. Oh world, continues
Mary, behold, then, thy time is the time of lovers:
“Et ecce, tempus tuum, tempus amantium.”<a id="FNanchor_1524" href="#Footnote_1524" class="fnanchor">[1524]</a> Now
that my Son, oh world, has died to save thee, this is
no longer for thee a time of fear, but of love; a time
to love him who has desired to suffer so much in order
to show thee the love he bore thee. Therefore, says
St. Bernard, is the heart of Jesus wounded that,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_584"></a>[584]</span>
through the visible wound, the invisible wound of love
may be seen.<a id="FNanchor_1525" href="#Footnote_1525" class="fnanchor">[1525]</a> If, then, concludes Mary, in the
words of the Abbot of Celles, my Son has wished his
side to be opened that he might give thee his heart,<a id="FNanchor_1526" href="#Footnote_1526" class="fnanchor">[1526]</a>
it is right, oh man, that thou shouldst give him thy
heart. And if you wish, oh children of Mary, to find
a place in the heart of Jesus without fear of being cast
out, go, says Ubertino of Casale, go with Mary, for
she will obtain grace for you;<a id="FNanchor_1527" href="#Footnote_1527" class="fnanchor">[1527]</a> and in the following
example we have a beautiful proof of this.</p>

<h5>EXAMPLE.</h5>

<p><i>The Disciple</i> relates<a id="FNanchor_1528" href="#Footnote_1528" class="fnanchor">[1528]</a> that there was once a poor
sinner who, among other crimes, had killed his father
and a brother, and therefore became a fugitive. Happening
to hear one day during Lent, a sermon upon
the divine mercy, he went to the preacher himself to
make his confession. The confessor having heard his
crimes, sent him to an altar of the sorrowful mother
to pray that she might obtain for him compunction
and pardon of his sins. The sinner obeyed, and began
to pray, when behold, suddenly overpowered by contrition,
he falls down dead. On the following day
when the priest recommended to the people to pray<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_585"></a>[585]</span>
for the deceased, a white dove appeared in the church
and let fall a card at the feet of the priest. He took
it up, and found these words written on it: “The soul
of the dead, when it left the body, immediately went to
paradise; and do you continue to preach the infinite
mercy of God.”</p>

<h5>PRAYER.</h5>

<p>Oh afflicted Virgin! oh soul, great in virtues and
great also in sorrows! for both arise from that great
fire of love thou hast for God; thou whose heart can
love nothing but God; ah mother, have pity on me,
for I have not loved God, and I have so much offended
him. Thy sorrows give me great confidence to hope
for pardon. But this is not enough; I wish to love
my Lord, and who can better obtain this for me than
thou—thou who art the mother of fair love? Ah
Mary, thou dost console all, comfort me also. Amen.</p>

<h4 id="DOLOR_VII">ON THE SEVENTH DOLOR.<br>
THE BURIAL OF THE BODY OF JESUS.</h4>

<p>When a mother is by the side of a suffering and
dying child, she no doubt then feels and suffers all
his pains; but when the afflicted child is really dead
and about to be buried, and the sorrowful mother
takes her last leave of him, oh God! the thought that
she is to see him no more is a sorrow that exceeds all
other sorrows. Behold, the last sword of sorrow<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_586"></a>[586]</span>
which we are to consider, when Mary, after being
present at the death of her Son upon the cross, after
having embraced his lifeless body, was finally to leave
him in the sepulchre, never more to enjoy his beloved
presence.</p>

<p>But that we may better understand this last dolor,
let us return to Calvary, again to look upon the afflicted
mother, who still holds, clasped in her arms, the lifeless
body of her Son. Oh my Son, she seems then
to continue to say in the words of Job, my Son, thou
art changed to be cruel towards me: “Mutatus es
mihi in crudelem.”<a id="FNanchor_1529" href="#Footnote_1529" class="fnanchor">[1529]</a> Yes, for all thy beauty, grace,
virtue, and loveliness, all the signs of special love thou
hast shown me, the peculiar favors thou hast bestowed
on me, are all changed into so many darts of sorrow,
which the more they have inflamed my love for thee,
so much the more cause me cruelly to feel the pain
of having lost thee. Ah, my beloved Son, in losing
thee I have lost all. Thus St. Bernard speaks in her
name: Oh truly begotten of God, thou wast to me a
father, a son, a spouse; thou wast my life! Now I
am deprived of my father, my spouse, and my Son,
for with my Son whom I have lost, I lose all things.<a id="FNanchor_1530" href="#Footnote_1530" class="fnanchor">[1530]</a></p>

<p>Thus Mary, clinging to her Son, was dissolved in
grief; but those holy disciples, fearing lest this poor
mother would expire there through agony, went to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_587"></a>[587]</span>
take the body of her Son from her arms, to bear it
away for burial. Therefore, with reverential force
they took him from her arms, and having embalmed
him, wrapped him in a linen cloth already prepared,
upon which our Lord wished to leave to the world
his image impressed, as may be seen at the present
day in Turin. And now they bear him to the sepulchre.
The sorrowful funeral train sets forth; the disciples
place him on their shoulders; hosts of angels
from heaven accompany him; those holy women follow
him; and the afflicted mother follows in their
company her Son to the grave. When they had
reached the appointed place, how gladly would Mary
have buried herself there alive with her Son! “Oh
how willingly,” said the Virgin to St. Bridget, “would
I have remained there alive with my Son, if it had
been his will!”<a id="FNanchor_1531" href="#Footnote_1531" class="fnanchor">[1531]</a> But since this was not the divine
will, the authors relate that she herself accompanied
the sacred body of Jesus into the sepulchre, where,
as Baronius narrates, they deposited the nails and the
crown of thorns. In raising the stone to close the
sepulchre, the disciples of the Saviour had to turn to
the Virgin, and say to her: Now, oh Lady, we must
close the sepulchre; have patience, look upon thy
Son and take leave of him for the last time. Then,
oh my beloved Son, must the afflicted mother have
said, then shall I see thee no more? Receive, then,
this last time that I look upon thee, receive the last<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_588"></a>[588]</span>
farewell from me thy dear mother, and receive my
heart which I leave buried with thee. The Virgin,
says St. Fulgentius, earnestly desired that her soul
should be buried with the body of Christ.<a id="FNanchor_1532" href="#Footnote_1532" class="fnanchor">[1532]</a> And
Mary herself made this revelation to St. Bridget: “I
can truly say, that at the burial of my Son, one sepulchre
contained as it were two hearts.”<a id="FNanchor_1533" href="#Footnote_1533" class="fnanchor">[1533]</a></p>

<p>Finally, they take the stone and close up in the
holy sepulchre the body of Jesus, that great treasure,
greater than any in heaven and on earth. And here
let us remark, that Mary left her heart buried with
Jesus, because Jesus was all her treasure: “Where
your treasure is, there will your heart be also.”<a id="FNanchor_1534" href="#Footnote_1534" class="fnanchor">[1534]</a> And
where shall we keep our hearts buried? With creatures?
In the mire? And why not with Jesus, who,
although he has ascended to heaven, has wished to
remain, not dead but alive, in the most holy sacrament
of the altar, precisely in order that he may have with
him and possess our hearts? But let us return to
Mary. Before quitting the sepulchre, according to St.
Bonaventure, she blessed that sacred stone, saying:
Oh happy stone that doth now inclose that body
which was contained nine months in my womb, I bless
thee, and envy thee; I leave thee to guard my Son
for me, who is my only good, my only love. And<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_589"></a>[589]</span>
then turning to the eternal Father, she said: Oh
Father, to thee I recommend him, who is thy Son and
mine; and thus bidding a last farewell to her Son,
and to the sepulchre, she returned to her own house.
This poor mother went away so afflicted and sad,
according to St. Bernard, that she moved many to
tears even against their will: “Multos etiam invitos
ad lacrymas provocabat;” so that wherever she passed,
all wept who met her: “Omnes plorabant qui obviabant
ei,” and could not restrain their tears. And he
adds, that those holy disciples, and the women who
accompanied her, mourned for her even more than for
their Lord.<a id="FNanchor_1535" href="#Footnote_1535" class="fnanchor">[1535]</a></p>

<p>St. Bonaventure says, that her two sisters covered
her with a mourning cloak: The sisters of our Lady
wrapped her in a veil as a widow, covering as it were
her whole countenance.<a id="FNanchor_1536" href="#Footnote_1536" class="fnanchor">[1536]</a> And he also says, that passing,
on her return, before the cross, still wet with the
blood of her Jesus, she was the first to adore it: Oh
holy cross, she exclaimed, I kiss thee and adore thee;
for thou art no longer an infamous wood, but a throne
of love, and an altar of mercy, consecrated by the
blood of the divine Lamb, who has been sacrificed
upon thee, for the salvation of the world. She then
leaves the cross and returns to her house; there the
afflicted mother casts her eyes around, and no longer
sees her Jesus; but instead of the presence of her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_590"></a>[590]</span>
dear Son, all the memorials of his holy life and cruel
death are before her. There she is reminded of the
embraces she gave her Son in the stable of Bethlehem,
of the conversations held with him for so many years
in the shop of Nazareth: she is reminded of their
mutual affection, of his loving looks, of the words of
eternal life that came forth from that divine mouth.
And then comes before her the fatal scene of that very
day; she sees those nails, those thorns, that lacerated
flesh of her Son, those deep wounds, those uncovered
bones, that open mouth, those closed eyes. Alas!
what a night of sorrow was that night for Mary! The
sorrowful mother turned to St. John, and said mournfully:
Ah, John, where is thy Master? Then she
asked of Magdalen: Daughter, tell me where is thy
beloved? Oh God! who has taken him from us?
Mary weeps, and all those who are with her weep.
And thou, oh my soul, dost thou not weep! Ah, turn
to Mary, and say to her with St. Bonaventure: Let
me, oh my Lady, let me weep; thou art innocent, I
am guilty.<a id="FNanchor_1537" href="#Footnote_1537" class="fnanchor">[1537]</a> At least entreat her to permit thee to
weep with her: “Fac ut tecum lugeam.” She weeps
for love, and thou dost weep through sorrow for thy
sins. And thus weeping, thou mayest have the happy
lot of him of whom we read in the following example.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_591"></a>[591]</span></p>

<h5>EXAMPLE.</h5>

<p>Father Engelgrave relates,<a id="FNanchor_1538" href="#Footnote_1538" class="fnanchor">[1538]</a> that a certain religious
was so tormented by scruples, that sometimes he was
almost driven to despair, but having great devotion to
Mary, the mother of sorrows, he had recourse to her
in the agony of his spirit, and was much comforted
by contemplating her dolors. Death came, and the
devil tormented him more than ever with scruples,
and tempted him to despair. When, behold our
merciful mother, seeing her poor son so afflicted, appeared
to him, and said to him: “And why, oh my
son, art thou so overcome with sorrow, thou who hast
so often consoled me by thy compassion for my sorrows?<a id="FNanchor_1539" href="#Footnote_1539" class="fnanchor">[1539]</a>
Be comforted,” she said to him; “Jesus sends
me to thee to console thee; be comforted, rejoice, and
come with me to paradise.” And at these words the
devout religious tranquilly expired, full of consolation
and confidence.</p>

<h5>PRAYER.</h5>

<p>My afflicted mother, I will not leave thee alone to
weep; no, I wish to keep thee company with my
tears. This grace I ask of thee to-day: obtain for
me a continual remembrance of the passion of Jesus,
and of thine also, and a tender devotion to them, that
all the remaining days of my life may be spent in
weeping for thy sorrows, oh my mother, and for those
of my Redeemer. I hope that these dolors will give me<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_592"></a>[592]</span>
the confidence and strength not to despair at the hour
of my death, at the sight of the offences I have committed
against my Lord. By these must I obtain pardon,
perseverance, paradise, where I hope to rejoice
with thee, and sing the infinite mercy of my God through
all eternity: thus I hope, thus may it be. Amen, amen.</p>

<p class="tb">Whoever wishes to practise the devotion of reciting
the chaplet of the dolors of Mary, will find it at the
end of the book. I composed this many years since,
and insert it anew here for the convenience of the servants
of Mary, whom I pray in their charity to recommend
me to her when they meditate upon her dolors.</p>

<p>Oh Lady, who dost ravish the hearts of men with
thy sweetness, hast thou not ravished mine? Oh,
ravisher of hearts, when wilt thou restore to me my
heart? Do with it as with thine own, and place it in
the side of thy Son. Then I shall possess what I
hope for, because thou art our hope.<a id="FNanchor_1540" href="#Footnote_1540" class="fnanchor">[1540]</a></p>

<div class="chapter">

<h3 class="nobreak" id="OF_THE_VIRTUES_OF_THE_MOST_HOLY_MARY">OF THE VIRTUES OF THE MOST HOLY MARY.</h3>

</div>

<p>St. Augustine says, that in order to obtain more
certainly and abundantly the favor of the saints, it is
necessary to imitate them, for when they see us practising<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_593"></a>[593]</span>
the virtues which they practised, then they are
more moved to pray for us. The queen of saints, and
our first advocate, Mary, after she has rescued a soul
from the grasp of Lucifer, and has united her to God,
wishes her to begin to imitate her example, otherwise
she will not be able to enrich her, as she would wish,
with her graces, seeing her so opposed to her in conduct.
Therefore Mary calls those blessed who diligently
imitate her life: “Now, therefore, children,
hear me; blessed are they that keep my ways.”<a id="FNanchor_1541" href="#Footnote_1541" class="fnanchor">[1541]</a>
He who loves, is like, or seeks to make himself like,
the person beloved, according to the celebrated proverb:
Love either finds or makes like: “Amor aut
pares invenit aut facit.” Hence St. Jerome tells us,
that if we love Mary, we must seek to imitate her, for
this is the greatest honor we can pay her.<a id="FNanchor_1542" href="#Footnote_1542" class="fnanchor">[1542]</a> Richard
says, those are and may call themselves true children
of Mary, who strive to imitate her life: “Filii Mariæ
imitatores ejus.” Let the child then endeavor, concludes
St. Bernard, to imitate the mother, if he desires
her favor; for when Mary sees that he honors her
as a mother, she will treat and favor him as a child.</p>

<p>Although there is little recorded in the Gospels of
the virtues of Mary in particular, yet, when they tell
us that she was full of grace, it is given us to understand
that she had all the virtues, and all in the heroic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_594"></a>[594]</span>
degree. So much so, that, as St. Thomas says,
whereas the other saints have excelled, each in some
one particular virtue, the blessed Virgin has excelled
in all, and in all the virtues has been given us for an
example.<a id="FNanchor_1543" href="#Footnote_1543" class="fnanchor">[1543]</a> And St. Ambrose also says: Such was
Mary, that her life alone is the example for all.<a id="FNanchor_1544" href="#Footnote_1544" class="fnanchor">[1544]</a> And
he afterwards adds: Let the virginity and life of Mary
be to you as an image, in which the form of virtue shines
forth. From thence obtain the model of your life ...
what you should correct, what avoid, what retain.<a id="FNanchor_1545" href="#Footnote_1545" class="fnanchor">[1545]</a>
And because, as the holy Fathers teach, humility is the
foundation of all the virtues, let us in the first place consider
how great was the humility of the mother of God.</p>

<h4 id="SECTION_I">SECTION I.<br>
OF THE HUMILITY OF MARY.</h4>

<p>Humility, says St. Bernard, is the foundation and
guardian of the virtues;<a id="FNanchor_1546" href="#Footnote_1546" class="fnanchor">[1546]</a> and with reason, for without
humility a soul can possess no other virtue. Let her
possess all the virtues, they will all depart when humility<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_595"></a>[595]</span>
departs. On the other hand, said St. Francis
of Sales, in a letter to St. Jane de Chantal, God so
loves humility that he instantly hastens to the soul in
which he sees it.<a id="FNanchor_1547" href="#Footnote_1547" class="fnanchor">[1547]</a> This virtue, so lovely and so necessary,
was unknown in the world; but the Son of
God himself came on earth to teach it by his example,
and he desired that in this we should especially strive
to imitate him: “Learn of me, because I am meek
and humble of heart.”<a id="FNanchor_1548" href="#Footnote_1548" class="fnanchor">[1548]</a> And Mary, as she was the
first and most perfect disciple of Jesus Christ in all
the virtues, was so in that of humility, by which she
merited to be exalted above all creatures. It was revealed
to St. Matilda that the first virtue which the
blessed mother especially practised from childhood,
was humility.<a id="FNanchor_1549" href="#Footnote_1549" class="fnanchor">[1549]</a></p>

<p>The first act of humility of heart is to have an humble
opinion of ourselves; and Mary always thought so
lowly of herself, as was revealed to the same St. Matilda,
that although she saw so many more graces
bestowed upon her than upon others, she preferred all
others before herself.<a id="FNanchor_1550" href="#Footnote_1550" class="fnanchor">[1550]</a> Rupert the Abbot, explaining
that passage, “Thou hast wounded my heart, my
sister, my spouse ... with one hair of thy neck,”<a id="FNanchor_1551" href="#Footnote_1551" class="fnanchor">[1551]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_596"></a>[596]</span>
says, that this hair of the neck of the spouse was precisely
that humble opinion which Mary had of herself,
with which she wounded the heart of God.<a id="FNanchor_1552" href="#Footnote_1552" class="fnanchor">[1552]</a> Not
that the holy Virgin esteemed herself a sinner, for humility
is truth, as St. Theresa says, and Mary knew
that she had never offended God; nor that she did
not confess having received greater graces from God
than any other creature, for an humble heart always
acknowledges the special favors of the Lord, that it
may humble itself the more; but the divine mother,
by the greater light she had to see the infinite greatness
and goodness of her God, saw still more her own
littleness, and therefore more than all others did she
humiliate herself, and say with the spouse of the
Canticles: “Do not consider that I am brown because
the sun hath altered my color.”<a id="FNanchor_1553" href="#Footnote_1553" class="fnanchor">[1553]</a> Approaching him,
I find myself black, as St. Bernard explains it: “Appropinquans
illi me nigram invenio.”<a id="FNanchor_1554" href="#Footnote_1554" class="fnanchor">[1554]</a> Yes, adds St.
Bernardine, for the Virgin had always present before
her eyes the divine majesty and her own nothingness.<a id="FNanchor_1555" href="#Footnote_1555" class="fnanchor">[1555]</a>
As a beggar, when she is clothed with a costly garment
which has been given her, is not made proud by
it, but humbles herself more before the giver, because<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_597"></a>[597]</span>
she is reminded then more of her poverty; thus, Mary,
the more she saw herself enriched, the more humble
she became, remembering that all was the gift of
God; whence she herself said to St. Elizabeth, a
Benedictine nun: “Know for certain that I esteemed
myself most abject, and unworthy of the grace of
God.”<a id="FNanchor_1556" href="#Footnote_1556" class="fnanchor">[1556]</a> And therefore, says St. Bernardine, no creature
in the world has been more exalted, because no
creature has ever humbled herself more than Mary.<a id="FNanchor_1557" href="#Footnote_1557" class="fnanchor">[1557]</a></p>

<p>Moreover, it is an act of humility to conceal the
gifts of heaven. Mary wished to conceal from St.
Joseph the grace of having been made the mother of
God, although it seemed necessary to make it known
to him, in order, at least, to remove from the mind of
her poor spouse the suspicions he might have of her
virtue, when he saw her pregnant; or at least his
perplexity, for in fact St. Joseph, on the one side, unwilling
to doubt the chastity of Mary, and, on the
other, ignorant of the mystery, in order to free himself
from perplexity, was minded to put her away privately:
“Voluit occulte dimittere eam.”<a id="FNanchor_1558" href="#Footnote_1558" class="fnanchor">[1558]</a> And if the
angel had not revealed to him that his spouse was
pregnant by the operation of the Holy Spirit, he
would really have left her. Moreover, an humble soul
also refuses praise, and gives it all to God. Behold,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_598"></a>[598]</span>
Mary is disturbed at hearing herself praised by St.
Gabriel. And when St. Elizabeth said to her, “Blessed
art thou among women ... and whence is this to
me, that the mother of my Lord should come to
me.... Blessed art thou that hast believed, &amp;c.,”<a id="FNanchor_1559" href="#Footnote_1559" class="fnanchor">[1559]</a>
Mary, referring all these praises to God, answered
with that humble Canticle: My soul doth magnify
the Lord: “Magnificat anima mea Dominum,” as if
she had said: You praise me, oh Elizabeth, but I
praise the Lord, to whom alone honor is due; you
wonder that I come to you, and I wonder at the divine
goodness in which alone my spirit exults. And
my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour: “Et exultavit
spiritus meus in Deo salutari meo.” You
praise me because I have believed; I praise my God,
because he has wished to exalt my nothingness; because
he hath regarded the humility of his handmaid:
“Quia respexit humilitatem ancillæ suæ.” Hence
Mary said to St. Bridget: “Why did I humble myself
so far, or why have I merited so much grace,
unless because I thought and knew that of and from
myself I was nothing, and had nothing? therefore I
would have no praise for myself, but only for the
Giver and Creator.”<a id="FNanchor_1560" href="#Footnote_1560" class="fnanchor">[1560]</a> Wherefore, speaking of the humility<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_599"></a>[599]</span>
of Mary, St. Augustine says: Oh truly blessed
humility, which has brought forth God to men, opened
paradise, and liberated souls from hell!<a id="FNanchor_1561" href="#Footnote_1561" class="fnanchor">[1561]</a></p>

<p>It is also a part of humility to serve others; and
Mary did not refuse to go and serve Elizabeth for
three months. Wherefore St. Bernard has said:
Elizabeth wondered that Mary should come to visit
her, but she should wonder still more that she did not
come to be ministered unto, but to minister.<a id="FNanchor_1562" href="#Footnote_1562" class="fnanchor">[1562]</a> The
humble retire and choose the lowest place; and therefore,
as St. Bernard remarks, Mary, when her Son
was preaching in a certain house, as St. Matthew relates,<a id="FNanchor_1563" href="#Footnote_1563" class="fnanchor">[1563]</a>
wished to speak with him, but would not enter
the house unbidden.<a id="FNanchor_1564" href="#Footnote_1564" class="fnanchor">[1564]</a> Therefore, when she was in
the “upper room” with the apostles, she wished to
take the lowest place, as St. Luke has related: “All
these were persevering with one mind in prayer, with
the women and Mary the mother of Jesus.”<a id="FNanchor_1565" href="#Footnote_1565" class="fnanchor">[1565]</a> Not
that St. Luke did not know the merit of the divine
mother, on account of which he should have given
her the first place; but because she had taken the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_600"></a>[600]</span>
lowest, after the apostles and the other women, therefore
St. Luke described all, as a certain author remarks,
just in the order of their places. Hence St.
Bernard says: Justly has the last become first, who,
when she was first of all, became last.<a id="FNanchor_1566" href="#Footnote_1566" class="fnanchor">[1566]</a> Finally, the
humble love contempt; therefore we do not find that
Mary appeared in Jerusalem on Palm Sunday, when
her Son was received with so much honor by the people;
but, on the other hand, at the time of the death
of her Son, she did not shrink from appearing in
public on Calvary, through fear of the disgrace of
being known as the mother of one who was condemned
as a criminal to die by an infamous death. Therefore
she said to St. Bridget: “What more contemptible
than to be called a fool, to be in want of all things,
to believe one’s self the most unworthy of all? Such,
oh daughter, was my humility, this was my joy, this
my entire will, with which I thought of nothing but to
please my Son.”<a id="FNanchor_1567" href="#Footnote_1567" class="fnanchor">[1567]</a></p>

<p>The venerable sister Paula of Foligno was given
to understand in an ecstasy how great was the humility
of the holy Virgin. In relating what she had seen to
her confessor, she said, scarcely able to utter the words
through astonishment: “Oh the humility of the blessed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_601"></a>[601]</span>
Virgin! Oh father! oh the humility of our blessed
Lady! In the world there is no humility, not even the
lowest degree of humility, to be compared with the
humility of Mary.” And our Lord, at another time,
showed St. Bridget two females, one all pomp and
vanity: “This one,” he said, “is Pride; but the other
whom you see with her head bent down, respectful to
all, having God alone in her mind, and having no
esteem for herself, is Humility, and is called Mary.”<a id="FNanchor_1568" href="#Footnote_1568" class="fnanchor">[1568]</a>
By this God wished to make known to us that his
blessed mother was so humble that she was humility
itself.</p>

<p>It is not to be doubted, as St. Gregory of Nyssa
says, that for our nature, corrupted by sin, there is
perhaps no virtue more difficult to practise than humility.
But there is no escape; we can never be true
children of Mary if we are not humble. If, says St.
Bernard, you cannot imitate the virginity, imitate the
humility of the humble Virgin.<a id="FNanchor_1569" href="#Footnote_1569" class="fnanchor">[1569]</a> She abhors the
proud, she invites none to come to her but the humble:
Whosoever is a little one, let him come to me:
“Si quis est parvulus, veniat ad me.” Mary, says
Richard, protects us under the mantle of humility:
“Maria protegit nos sub pallio humilitatis.” The
mother of God herself explained this to St. Bridget,
saying: “Come, then, oh my daughter, and hide
thyself under my mantle; this mantle is my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_602"></a>[602]</span>
humility.”<a id="FNanchor_1570" href="#Footnote_1570" class="fnanchor">[1570]</a> And she then added, that the contemplation
of her humility was a good mantle, that keeps us warm;
but, as she afterwards said: “The mantle only warms
him who wears it, not only in thought but in fact; thus
my humility does not profit unless every one strives to
imitate it. Therefore, my daughter,” she concludes,
“clothe thyself with this humility.”<a id="FNanchor_1571" href="#Footnote_1571" class="fnanchor">[1571]</a> Oh, how dear
to Mary is the humble soul! St. Bernard writes:
The Virgin recognizes and loves those who love her,
and she is near to all who invoke her, especially to
those whom she sees like herself in chastity and humility.<a id="FNanchor_1572" href="#Footnote_1572" class="fnanchor">[1572]</a>
Wherefore the saint then exhorts all those who
love Mary, to be humble: Emulate this virtue if you
love Mary.<a id="FNanchor_1573" href="#Footnote_1573" class="fnanchor">[1573]</a> Marino, or Martino d’Alberto, of the
Society of Jesus, through love of the Virgin, was
accustomed to sweep the house and collect the filth.
The divine mother once appeared to him, as Father
Nierembergh relates in his Life, and as if thanking
him, said: “How dear to me is this humble action
done for love of me!” Then, oh my queen, I shall
never be a true child of thine, if I am not humble.
But do you not see that my sins, after having rendered
me ungrateful to my Lord, have also made me proud?<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_603"></a>[603]</span>
Oh, my mother, cure me; by thy merits obtain for
me that I may be humble, and thus become a child
of thine. Amen.</p>

<h4 id="SECTION_II">SECTION II.<br>
OF THE CHARITY OF MARY TOWARDS GOD.</h4>

<p>St. Anselm says, that where there is the greatest
purity, there is the greatest charity: “Ubi major
puritas, ibi major charitas.” The purer and more
emptied of self is a heart, the more it will be filled
with charity towards God. Most holy Mary, because
she was all humility, and entirely emptied of self, was
entirely filled with the divine love, so that she surpassed
all men and all angels in love to God, as St.
Bernardine teaches.<a id="FNanchor_1574" href="#Footnote_1574" class="fnanchor">[1574]</a> Therefore St. Francis of Sales
has justly called her: The queen of love. The Lord
indeed has given to men the precept to love him with
their whole heart: “Thou shalt love the Lord thy
God with thy whole heart;”<a id="FNanchor_1575" href="#Footnote_1575" class="fnanchor">[1575]</a> but, as St. Thomas declares,
this precept will never be perfectly fulfilled by
men on this earth, but in heaven.<a id="FNanchor_1576" href="#Footnote_1576" class="fnanchor">[1576]</a> And here the
blessed Albertus Magnus remarks, that in a certain
sense, it would be unbecoming for God to give a commandment<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_604"></a>[604]</span>
which none could perfectly fulfil, if the
divine mother had not perfectly fulfilled it. These
are the words of Albertus: Either some one fulfils
this precept or no one; if any one, it is the most
blessed Virgin.<a id="FNanchor_1577" href="#Footnote_1577" class="fnanchor">[1577]</a> And this is confirmed by Richard
of St. Victor, who says: The mother of our Emmanuel
was perfect in all virtues. Who has ever fulfilled
as she did that first commandment: “Thou shalt love
the Lord thy God with thy whole heart?” In her
the divine love was so ardent, that there could be no
defect of any kind in her.<a id="FNanchor_1578" href="#Footnote_1578" class="fnanchor">[1578]</a> Divine love, says St.
Bernard, so penetrated and pervaded the soul of Mary,
that no part was left untouched by it, so that she
loved with her whole heart, her whole soul, and her
whole strength, and was full of grace.<a id="FNanchor_1579" href="#Footnote_1579" class="fnanchor">[1579]</a> Wherefore
Mary might well have said: My beloved has given
himself wholly to me, and I have given myself wholly
to him: My beloved to me, and I to him: “Dilectus
meus mihi, et ego illi.”<a id="FNanchor_1580" href="#Footnote_1580" class="fnanchor">[1580]</a> Ah, says Richard, well
might even the seraphim descend from heaven to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_605"></a>[605]</span>
learn from the heart of the Virgin how to love
God.<a id="FNanchor_1581" href="#Footnote_1581" class="fnanchor">[1581]</a></p>

<p>God, who is love: “Deus charitas est,”<a id="FNanchor_1582" href="#Footnote_1582" class="fnanchor">[1582]</a> came on
earth to kindle in all men the flame of his holy love;
but he inflamed no heart so much as the heart of his
mother, who, being entirely pure from every earthly
affection, was perfectly ready to be enkindled by this
blessed flame. Thus St. Jerome teaches.<a id="FNanchor_1583" href="#Footnote_1583" class="fnanchor">[1583]</a> Hence
the heart of Mary became all fire and flames, as we
read of her in the sacred Canticles: The lamps thereof
are fire and flames: “Lampades ejus, lampades ignis,
atque flammarum.”<a id="FNanchor_1584" href="#Footnote_1584" class="fnanchor">[1584]</a> Fire burning within, through
love, as St. Anselm explains,<a id="FNanchor_1585" href="#Footnote_1585" class="fnanchor">[1585]</a> and flames shining forth
upon all, by the practice of virtue. Mary, therefore,
when she bore Jesus in her arms, might indeed have
called herself: Fire carrying fire: “Ignis gestans
ignem,” more properly than a certain woman who was
carrying fire in her hand was so called by Hippocrates.
Yes, for St. Ildephonsus said: As fire heats iron, the
Holy Spirit so wholly inflamed Mary that nothing was
seen in her but the flame of the Holy Ghost, nothing
was felt but the fire of the love of God.<a id="FNanchor_1586" href="#Footnote_1586" class="fnanchor">[1586]</a> St. Thomas<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_606"></a>[606]</span>
of Villanova says that the bush which Moses saw entirely
in flames without being consumed, was really a
symbol of the heart of the Virgin. Wherefore with
reason, as St. Bernard says, was she seen by St. John
clothed with the sun: And there appeared a great
wonder in heaven, a woman clothed with the sun:
“Et signum apparuit in cœlo, mulier amicta sole.”<a id="FNanchor_1587" href="#Footnote_1587" class="fnanchor">[1587]</a>
For, says the saint, she was so united to God by love
that it seems as if no creature could be more united to
him. Mary, then, is justly described as clothed with
the sun, for she has penetrated to an incredible depth
the abyss of divine wisdom, so that, as far as it
is permitted to a creature not personally united
with God, she appears immersed in that inaccessible
light.<a id="FNanchor_1588" href="#Footnote_1588" class="fnanchor">[1588]</a></p>

<p>Therefore St. Bonaventure asserts, that the holy
Virgin was never tempted by the spirits of hell: For
as flies, he says, are driven away by a great fire, so
from the heart of Mary, which was one flame of love,
the devils fled, and did not even dare to approach
her.<a id="FNanchor_1589" href="#Footnote_1589" class="fnanchor">[1589]</a> And Richard also says: The Virgin was terrible
to the princes of darkness, so that they did not
presume to approach and tempt her, for the flame of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_607"></a>[607]</span>
charity deterred them.<a id="FNanchor_1590" href="#Footnote_1590" class="fnanchor">[1590]</a> Mary herself revealed to St.
Bridget, that in this world she had no other thought,
no other desire, no other joy, than God: I thought of
nothing but God; nothing pleased me but God:
“Nihil nisi Deum cogitabam, nulla mihi nisi Deus placuerunt.”
So that her blessed soul being, as it were, on
this earth in a continual contemplation of God, the acts
of love she made were innumerable; as Father Suarez
has declared: The acts of perfect love which the
blessed Virgin made in this life were innumerable, for
she passed almost her whole life in contemplation, and
was very frequently repeating an act of love.<a id="FNanchor_1591" href="#Footnote_1591" class="fnanchor">[1591]</a> But
Bernard de Bustis pleases me more when he says, that
Mary did not so much repeat the acts of love in order,
as other saints do, but, by a singular privilege, always
actually loved God with one continued act.<a id="FNanchor_1592" href="#Footnote_1592" class="fnanchor">[1592]</a>
Like the royal eagle she kept her eye always fixed
upon the divine Sun, so that, as St. Peter Damian
says, neither did the actions of life prevent her from
loving, nor love prevent her from acting.<a id="FNanchor_1593" href="#Footnote_1593" class="fnanchor">[1593]</a> Thus, says<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_608"></a>[608]</span>
St. Germanus, Mary was prefigured by the altar of
propitiation, on which the fire was never extinguished
by day or by night.</p>

<p>Neither did sleep interrupt the love of Mary for her
God. For if such a privilege was given to our first
parents in the state of innocence, as St. Augustine asserts,
saying: Their dreams when sleeping were as
happy as their life when waking: “Tam felicia erant
somnia dormientium, quam vita vigilantium,”<a id="FNanchor_1594" href="#Footnote_1594" class="fnanchor">[1594]</a> it certainly
could not be denied to the divine mother, as
Suarez and Rupert the Abbot believe, with St. Bernardine
and St. Ambrose, who has written concerning
Mary: While her body rested, her soul watched:
“Cum quiesceret corpus, vigilaret animus.”<a id="FNanchor_1595" href="#Footnote_1595" class="fnanchor">[1595]</a> Thus
were verified in her the words of the wise man: Her
lamp shall not be put out in the night: “Non extinguetur
in nocte lucerna ejus.”<a id="FNanchor_1596" href="#Footnote_1596" class="fnanchor">[1596]</a> Yes, for while her
blessed body, with a light sleep, took its needed rest,
her soul, says St. Bernardine, freely rose to God, so at
that time her contemplation was more perfect than is
that of any other person when awake.<a id="FNanchor_1597" href="#Footnote_1597" class="fnanchor">[1597]</a> Therefore
could she well say with the spouse in the Canticles:
I sleep and my heart watcheth: “Ego dormio et cor
meum vigilat.”<a id="FNanchor_1598" href="#Footnote_1598" class="fnanchor">[1598]</a> Happy in sleep as in waking: “Tam
felix dormiendo, quam vigilando,” as Suarez says. In<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_609"></a>[609]</span>
a word, St. Bernardine asserts, that Mary, while she
lived on earth, was continually loving God: “Mens
Virginis in ardore dilectionis continue tenebatur.”<a id="FNanchor_1599" href="#Footnote_1599" class="fnanchor">[1599]</a>
And he adds further, that she never did any thing
that she did not know was pleasing to God; and that
she loved him as much as she knew he ought to be
loved.<a id="FNanchor_1600" href="#Footnote_1600" class="fnanchor">[1600]</a> Hence, according to blessed Albertus Magnus,
it may be said that Mary was filled with so great
charity that a greater was not possible in any pure
creature on this earth.<a id="FNanchor_1601" href="#Footnote_1601" class="fnanchor">[1601]</a> For this reason St. Thomas
of Villanova has said, that the Virgin, by her ardent
charity, was made so beautiful and so enamored her
God, that captivated as it were, by love of her, he
descended into her womb to become man.<a id="FNanchor_1602" href="#Footnote_1602" class="fnanchor">[1602]</a> Wherefore
St. Bernardine exclaims: Behold a Virgin who
by her virtue has wounded and taken captive the
heart of God.<a id="FNanchor_1603" href="#Footnote_1603" class="fnanchor">[1603]</a></p>

<p>But since Mary loves her God so much, she certainly
requires from her servants nothing else so much<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_610"></a>[610]</span>
as that they should love God as much as they can.
And precisely this she said to the blessed Angela de
Foligno one day after communion: “Angela, may
you be blessed by my Son; seek to love him as much
as you can.” And the blessed Virgin herself said to
St. Bridget: Daughter, if you wish to bind me to you,
love my Son: “Si vis me tecum devincire, ama filium
meum.” Mary desires nothing more than to see her
beloved, who is God, loved by all. Novarino asks
why the holy Virgin, with the spouse of the Canticles,
begged the angels to make known to her Lord the
great love she bore him, saying: “I adjure you, oh
daughters of Jerusalem, if you find my beloved, that
you tell him that I languish with love.”<a id="FNanchor_1604" href="#Footnote_1604" class="fnanchor">[1604]</a> Did not
God know how much she loved him? Why does she
desire to show the wound to her beloved who gave the
wound? “Cur vulnus ostendi quærit dilecto qui vulnus
fecit?” The same author answers, that the divine
mother did not wish by this to make known her
love to God, but to us; that, as she was wounded,
she might be able to wound us also with divine love:
“Ut vulnerata vulneret.”<a id="FNanchor_1605" href="#Footnote_1605" class="fnanchor">[1605]</a> And because she was
wholly inflamed with the love of God, she inflames all
those who love and approach her, and renders them
like herself.<a id="FNanchor_1606" href="#Footnote_1606" class="fnanchor">[1606]</a> For this reason St. Catharine of Sienna<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_611"></a>[611]</span>
called Mary: The bearer of the flame of divine love:
“Portatrix ignis.” If we also wish to burn with this
blessed flame, let us always endeavor to draw near to
our mother with prayers and affections.</p>

<p>Oh queen of love, Mary, the most lovely, the most
beloved, and the most loving of all creatures, as St.
Francis of Sales said to thee: Ah, my mother, thou
wert always wholly inflamed with love to God; ah,
deign to bestow on me at least one spark of it.
Thou didst pray thy Son for that family whose wine
had failed: They have no wine: “Vinum non habent,”
and wilt thou not pray for us, who are wanting in love
to God, whom we are under such obligations to love?
Say to Jesus: They have no love: “Amorem non
habent.” Do thou obtain for us this love. We ask
of thee no other favor than this. Oh mother, by the
great love thou hast for Jesus, graciously hear us and
pray for us. Amen.</p>

<h4 id="SECTION_III">SECTION III.<br>
OF THE CHARITY OF MARY FOR HER NEIGHBOR.</h4>

<p>Love to God and our neighbor is commanded by
the same precept: “And this commandment we have
from God, that he who loveth God, love also his
neighbor.”<a id="FNanchor_1607" href="#Footnote_1607" class="fnanchor">[1607]</a> And St. Thomas gives it as a reason for
this, that he who loves God, loves all things which
God loves. St. Catherine of Genoa one day said to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_612"></a>[612]</span>
God: “Oh Lord, it is thy will that I love my neighbor,
and I can love none but thee.” God answered her in
these words: “He who loves me, loves all things loved
by me.” But as there never has been and never will
be one who loves God more than Mary; so there never
has been and never will be one who loves his neighbor
more than Mary. Cornelius à Lapide, remarking on
these words: “King Solomon hath made him a litter
of the wood of Libanus ... the midst he covered with
charity for the daughters of Jerusalem,”<a id="FNanchor_1608" href="#Footnote_1608" class="fnanchor">[1608]</a> says, that
this litter was the womb of Mary, in which the incarnate
Word dwelt, filling the mother with charity, that
she might succor all who had recourse to her.<a id="FNanchor_1609" href="#Footnote_1609" class="fnanchor">[1609]</a> Mary
was so full of charity when she was on earth, that she
assisted unasked, those who were in need, just as she
did at the marriage of Cana, when she told her Son
of the trouble of the family: They have no wine:
“Vinum non habent,”<a id="FNanchor_1610" href="#Footnote_1610" class="fnanchor">[1610]</a> and begged him to give them
wine by a miracle. Oh! how she hastened to the relief
of her neighbor, when she went to the house of
Elizabeth on an errand of charity: She went into the
hill country in haste: “Abiit in montana cum festinatione.”<a id="FNanchor_1611" href="#Footnote_1611" class="fnanchor">[1611]</a>
She could in no way show greater charity
than by offering her Son for our salvation; so that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_613"></a>[613]</span>
St. Bonaventure says: Mary so loved the world as to
give her only-begotten Son.<a id="FNanchor_1612" href="#Footnote_1612" class="fnanchor">[1612]</a> Therefore St. Anselm
addresses her in these words: Oh, blessed among women,
who dost excel the angels in purity, and the saints
in pity!<a id="FNanchor_1613" href="#Footnote_1613" class="fnanchor">[1613]</a> Neither does the charity of Mary for us
fail, says St. Bonaventure, now she is in heaven; but
is much increased there. Because now she sees more
clearly the miseries of men.<a id="FNanchor_1614" href="#Footnote_1614" class="fnanchor">[1614]</a> Hence the saint said:
Great was the mercy of Mary towards the wretched
when she was still an exile on earth; but it is far
greater now that she is reigning in heaven.<a id="FNanchor_1615" href="#Footnote_1615" class="fnanchor">[1615]</a> And the
angel said to St. Bridget, that there is no one who
prays that does not receive graces through the charity
of the Virgin.<a id="FNanchor_1616" href="#Footnote_1616" class="fnanchor">[1616]</a> Miserable should we be were Mary not
to pray for us. Jesus Christ himself also said to the
same saint: “If the prayers of my mother did not
interpose, there would be no hope of mercy.”<a id="FNanchor_1617" href="#Footnote_1617" class="fnanchor">[1617]</a></p>

<p>Blessed is he, says the divine mother, who hears my
teachings and considers my charity, in order to practise
it towards others in imitation of me: “Blessed is
the man that heareth me, and that watcheth daily at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_614"></a>[614]</span>
my gates, and waiteth at the posts of my doors.”<a id="FNanchor_1618" href="#Footnote_1618" class="fnanchor">[1618]</a>
St. Gregory Nazianzen says, that there is nothing by
which we may more surely gain the love of Mary, than
by the practice of charity towards our neighbor.<a id="FNanchor_1619" href="#Footnote_1619" class="fnanchor">[1619]</a>
Hence, as God commands us, saying, “Be ye merciful,
as your Father also is merciful;”<a id="FNanchor_1620" href="#Footnote_1620" class="fnanchor">[1620]</a> so Mary appears to
say to all her children: Be ye merciful, as your mother
also is merciful.<a id="FNanchor_1621" href="#Footnote_1621" class="fnanchor">[1621]</a> It is certain that God and Mary
will show mercy to us, according to the charity we
practise towards our neighbor. “Give, and it shall
be given to you.” “For with the same measure that
you shall mete withal, it shall be measured to you
again.”<a id="FNanchor_1622" href="#Footnote_1622" class="fnanchor">[1622]</a> St. Methodius said: Give to the poor and
receive paradise: “Da pauperi et accipe Paradisum:”
for, according to the apostle, charity towards our
neighbor renders us happy in this life and the next:
“But piety is profitable to all things, having promise
of the life that now is, and of that which is to come.”<a id="FNanchor_1623" href="#Footnote_1623" class="fnanchor">[1623]</a>
St. John Chrysostom, remarking on the words of
Proverbs, “He that hath mercy on the poor, lendeth<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_615"></a>[615]</span>
to the Lord,”<a id="FNanchor_1624" href="#Footnote_1624" class="fnanchor">[1624]</a> says, that he who assists the needy,
makes God his debtor.<a id="FNanchor_1625" href="#Footnote_1625" class="fnanchor">[1625]</a> Oh mother of mercy, thou
art full of charity for all. Do not forget my miseries.
Thou dost even now see them. Recommend me to
that God who denies thee nothing. Obtain for me
the grace of being able to imitate thee in holy charity
towards God and towards my neighbor. Amen.</p>

OF THE FAITH OF MARY.</h4>

<p>As the blessed Virgin is the mother of love and of
hope, thus, also, is she the mother of faith. “I am
the mother of fair love, and of fear, and knowledge,
and of holy hope.”<a id="FNanchor_1626" href="#Footnote_1626" class="fnanchor">[1626]</a> And justly, says St. Iræneus,
since Mary repaired by her faith that loss which Eve
caused by her incredulity.<a id="FNanchor_1627" href="#Footnote_1627" class="fnanchor">[1627]</a> Eve, Tertullian also
says, because she chose to believe the serpent rather
than the Word of God, brought death into the world;
but our queen, believing the words of the angel, that
she, remaining a virgin, was to become the mother of
the Lord, brought salvation to the world.<a id="FNanchor_1628" href="#Footnote_1628" class="fnanchor">[1628]</a> For St.
Augustine says that Mary, giving her consent to the
incarnation of the Word, by means of her faith<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_616"></a>[616]</span>
opened paradise to men.<a id="FNanchor_1629" href="#Footnote_1629" class="fnanchor">[1629]</a> Also Richard, commenting
on the words of St. Paul, “For the unbelieving
husband is sanctified by the believing wife,”<a id="FNanchor_1630" href="#Footnote_1630" class="fnanchor">[1630]</a> says:
This is the believing woman by whose faith the unbelieving
Adam and all his posterity are saved.<a id="FNanchor_1631" href="#Footnote_1631" class="fnanchor">[1631]</a>
Hence, on account of her faith, Elizabeth pronounced
the Virgin blessed: Blessed art thou that hast believed,
because those things shall be accomplished in
thee that were spoken by the Lord.<a id="FNanchor_1632" href="#Footnote_1632" class="fnanchor">[1632]</a> And St. Augustine
added: Mary is more blessed by receiving the
faith of Christ than by conceiving the flesh of Christ.<a id="FNanchor_1633" href="#Footnote_1633" class="fnanchor">[1633]</a></p>

<p>Father Suarez says that the holy Virgin had more
faith than all men and all the angels. She saw her
Son in the stable of Bethlehem, and believed him the
Creator of the world. She saw him flying from
Herod, and yet believed that he was the King of
kings. She saw him born, and believed him to be
eternal. She saw him poor and in need of food, and
believed him to be Lord of the universe; laid on straw,
and she believed him omnipotent. She observed that
he did not speak, and she believed him to be the infinite
Wisdom. She heard him weeping, and she believed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_617"></a>[617]</span>
him to be the joy of paradise. Finally, she
saw him in death, despised and crucified, but although
the faith of others might have wavered, Mary remained
firm in the belief that he was God. St. Antoninus
says, remarking on the words: There stood by the
cross of Jesus his mother: “Stabat juxta crucem Jesu
mater ejus,” Mary stood supported by her faith,
which she retained firm in the divinity of Christ.<a id="FNanchor_1634" href="#Footnote_1634" class="fnanchor">[1634]</a>
And it is for this reason, says the saint, that in the
office of Tenebræ, only one candle is left lighted.
St. Leo, when treating of this subject, applies to the
Virgin this passage of Proverbs: “Her lamp shall
not be put out in the night.”<a id="FNanchor_1635" href="#Footnote_1635" class="fnanchor">[1635]</a> On the words of
Isaias, “I have trodden the wine-press alone, and of
the Gentiles, there is not a man with me,”<a id="FNanchor_1636" href="#Footnote_1636" class="fnanchor">[1636]</a> St.
Thomas remarks: He says a man, on account of the
Virgin, in whom faith never failed.<a id="FNanchor_1637" href="#Footnote_1637" class="fnanchor">[1637]</a> Whence the blessed
Albertus Magnus says, that Mary practised then a
most perfect faith. She had faith in a most excellent
degree; who, even when the disciples were doubting,
did not doubt. Mary, therefore, by her great faith
merited to become the light of all the faithful, as St.
Methodius calls her: “Fidelium fax.” And by St.
Cyril of Alexandria: The queen of the true faith:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_618"></a>[618]</span>
“Sceptrum orthodoxæ fidei.” And the holy Church
herself attributes to the Virgin, by the merit of her
faith, the destruction of all heresies: “Rejoice, oh
Virgin Mary, for thou alone hast destroyed all heresies
throughout the world.”<a id="FNanchor_1638" href="#Footnote_1638" class="fnanchor">[1638]</a> St. Thomas of Villanova
also says, explaining the words of the Holy Spirit,
“Thou hast wounded my heart, my sister, my spouse
... with one of thy eyes,”<a id="FNanchor_1639" href="#Footnote_1639" class="fnanchor">[1639]</a> that the eyes signify faith,
by which the Virgin gave the greatest pleasure to the
Son of God.<a id="FNanchor_1640" href="#Footnote_1640" class="fnanchor">[1640]</a></p>

<p>St. Ildephonsus exhorts us to imitate the faith of
Mary: “Imitamini signaculum fidei Mariæ.” But
how are we to imitate this faith of Mary? Faith is
at the same time a gift and a virtue. It is a gift of
God, in so far as it is a light which God infuses into
the soul, and it is also a virtue in so far as it is exercised
by the soul. Hence faith is given us not only
to serve as a rule of belief, but also of action. Therefore
St. Gregory says: He truly believes who, by his
works, practises what he believes.<a id="FNanchor_1641" href="#Footnote_1641" class="fnanchor">[1641]</a> And St. Augustine:
Thou sayest, “I believe,” do what you say, and
it is faith.<a id="FNanchor_1642" href="#Footnote_1642" class="fnanchor">[1642]</a> And this is to have a lively faith, namely,
to live according to our belief. “My just man liveth<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_619"></a>[619]</span>
by faith.”<a id="FNanchor_1643" href="#Footnote_1643" class="fnanchor">[1643]</a> It was thus the blessed Virgin lived, very
differently from those who do not live according to
what they believe, whose faith is dead, as St. James
says: Faith without good works is dead: “Fide sine
operibus mortua est.”<a id="FNanchor_1644" href="#Footnote_1644" class="fnanchor">[1644]</a> Diogenes went about seeking
a man upon earth: “Hominem quæro;” but God
seems seeking a Christian among the many faithful:
“Christianum quæro.” For very few are they who
have the works, the greater part have only the name;
but to these should be said what Alexander said to
that cowardly soldier who was also named Alexander:
Change either your name or your conduct: “Aut
nomen, aut mores muta.” But, as Father Avila used
to say: It would be better if these miserable creatures
were put in confinement as madmen, believing
as they do, that a happy eternity is prepared for him
who lives well, and an unhappy eternity for him who
lives ill, and yet living as if they did not believe this.
St. Augustine therefore exhorts us to see things with
Christian eyes, that is, to see according to faith:
“Oculos Christianorum habete.” For St. Theresa
was accustomed to say, that all sins arise from a want
of faith. Let us therefore implore the holy Virgin,
that by the merit of her faith she may obtain for us
a lively faith. Oh Lady, increase our faith: Domina
adauge nobis fidem.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_620"></a>[620]</span></p>

<h4 id="SECTION_V">SECTION V.<br>
OF THE HOPE OF MARY.</h4>

<p>From faith springs hope, for God enlightens us by
faith with a knowledge of his goodness and his promises,
that we may rise by hope to the desire of possessing
him. Mary, then, having the virtue of an
extraordinary faith, had also the virtue of an extraordinary
hope, which made her say with David: “But
it is good for me to adhere to my God, and to put my
hope in the Lord God.”<a id="FNanchor_1645" href="#Footnote_1645" class="fnanchor">[1645]</a> Mary was, indeed, that
faithful spouse of the Holy Spirit, of whom it was
said: “Who is this that cometh up from the desert,
flowing with delights, leaning on her beloved?”<a id="FNanchor_1646" href="#Footnote_1646" class="fnanchor">[1646]</a> For
she was always perfectly detached from affection to the
world, which to her appeared a desert; and placing
no confidence either in creatures or her own merits,
but relying entirely on divine grace, in which alone
she trusted, she always advanced in the divine love;
and thus Ailgrin said of her: She ascended from the
desert, that is, from the world, which she deserted and
esteemed such a desert, that she turned away from it
all her affection. Leaning upon her beloved; for she
trusted not in her own merits, but in the grace of him
who bestows grace.<a id="FNanchor_1647" href="#Footnote_1647" class="fnanchor">[1647]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_621"></a>[621]</span></p>

<p>And the holy Virgin plainly showed how great was
her confidence in God: first, when she saw the trouble
of her holy spouse, Joseph, because he knew not the
mode of her miraculous pregnancy, and thought of
leaving her: But Joseph ... minded to put her away
privately: “Joseph autem ... voluit occulte dimittere
eam.”<a id="FNanchor_1648" href="#Footnote_1648" class="fnanchor">[1648]</a> It appeared then necessary, as we have
already said, that she should discover to Joseph the
hidden mystery; but no, she would not herself reveal
the grace she had received; she thought it better to
abandon herself to divine providence, trusting that
God himself would protect her innocence and her
reputation. Cornelius à Lapide makes precisely the
same remark, commenting upon these very words of
the Gospel: The blessed Virgin was unwilling to make
known this secret to Joseph, lest she should seem to
boast of her gifts, but resigned herself in perfect confidence
to the care of God, trusting that he would
protect her innocence and reputation.<a id="FNanchor_1649" href="#Footnote_1649" class="fnanchor">[1649]</a> Moreover, she
showed her confidence in God when, as the time for
the birth of Christ approached, she saw herself in
Bethlehem shut out from the lodgings even of the poor,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_622"></a>[622]</span>
and obliged to bring forth her Son in a stable: “And
she laid him in a manger, because there was no room
for him in the inn.”<a id="FNanchor_1650" href="#Footnote_1650" class="fnanchor">[1650]</a> She did not then utter a single
word of complaint, but abandoning herself to God,
trusted that he would assist her in her need. The
divine mother also showed how much she trusted in
the divine providence, when warned by Joseph that
they were obliged to fly into Egypt, she set out the
same night on so long a journey to a foreign and unknown
country, without preparation, without money,
without other company than that of her infant Jesus
and her poor spouse: “Who arose and took the child
and his mother by night, and retired into Egypt.”<a id="FNanchor_1651" href="#Footnote_1651" class="fnanchor">[1651]</a>
But much more did Mary make known her confidence,
when she asked from her Son the favor of the miracle
of wine at the marriage of Cana; for having said:
They have no wine: “Vinum non habent;” Jesus
answered her: “Woman, what is it to thee and to
me? my hour has not yet come.”<a id="FNanchor_1652" href="#Footnote_1652" class="fnanchor">[1652]</a> But after this
answer, by which it seemed clearly that he refused
her request, she, trusting in the divine goodness, directed
the people of the house to do as the Son should
order, because the grace was secure; Whatsoever he
shall say to you, do ye: “Quodcumque dixerit vobis<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_623"></a>[623]</span>
facite.” And Jesus Christ did, indeed, order that the
vessels should be filled with water, and then changed
it into wine.</p>

<p>Let us learn then from Mary to trust in God as
we ought, but principally as to what concerns our
eternal salvation, in which, although our co-operation
is necessary, yet we ought to hope from God alone
the grace necessary for obtaining it, entirely distrusting
our own strength, and saying with the apostle: I can
do all things in him who strengtheneth me: “Omnia
possum in eo qui me confortat.”<a id="FNanchor_1653" href="#Footnote_1653" class="fnanchor">[1653]</a></p>

<p>Ah, my most holy Lady, of thee Ecclesiasticus says,
that thou art the mother of holy hope: “Mater sanctæ
spei.”<a id="FNanchor_1654" href="#Footnote_1654" class="fnanchor">[1654]</a> The holy Church says of thee that thou
art hope itself: Hail, our hope: “Spes nostra salve.”
What other hope then am I seeking? Thou, after
Christ, art all my hope; thus St. Bernard called thee,
thus I also wish to call thee: The whole reason of
my hope: “Tota ratio spes meæ;” and I will always
say to thee with St. Bonaventure: Oh salvation of
those who invoke thee, save me: “O salus te invocantium
salva me.”</p>

<h4 id="SECTION_VI">SECTION VI.<br>
OF THE CHASTITY OF MARY.</h4>

<p>Since the fall of Adam the flesh being rebellious
against reason, the virtue of chastity is the most difficult
for men to practise. Of all combats, says St.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_624"></a>[624]</span>
Augustine, those of chastity are the most severe, for
the battle is daily and the victory rare.<a id="FNanchor_1655" href="#Footnote_1655" class="fnanchor">[1655]</a> But eternal
praise to the Lord who has given us in Mary a great
example of this virtue. With justice, says blessed
Albertus Magnus, is Mary called the Virgin of virgins,
for she being the first who offered her virginity to
God, without the counsel or example of others, has
brought to him all virgins who imitate her.<a id="FNanchor_1656" href="#Footnote_1656" class="fnanchor">[1656]</a> As
David had already predicted: After her virgins shall
be brought to the temple of the king: “Adducentur
virgines post eam in templum regis.”<a id="FNanchor_1657" href="#Footnote_1657" class="fnanchor">[1657]</a> Without counsel
or example; yes, for St. Bernard exclaims: Oh
Virgin, who has taught thee to please God by virginity,
and on earth to lead the life of an angel?<a id="FNanchor_1658" href="#Footnote_1658" class="fnanchor">[1658]</a> Ah!
answers Sophronius, it is for this God has chosen this
most pure Virgin for his mother, that she may be an
example of chastity to all.<a id="FNanchor_1659" href="#Footnote_1659" class="fnanchor">[1659]</a> Hence St. Ambrose has
called Mary the standard-bearer of chastity: “Quæ
signum Virginitatis extulit.”</p>

<p>By reason of this her purity the blessed Virgin was
also called by the Holy Spirit: Beautiful as the turtle-dove:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_625"></a>[625]</span>
Thy cheeks are beautiful as the turtle-dove’s:
“Pulchræ sunt genæ tuæ sicut turturis.”<a id="FNanchor_1660" href="#Footnote_1660" class="fnanchor">[1660]</a> Mary,
says St. Aponius, is a most chaste turtle: “Turtur
pudicissima Maria.” And therefore she has also been
called a lily: As the lily among the thorns, so is my
love among the daughters: “Sicut lilium inter spinas,
sic amica mea inter filias.”<a id="FNanchor_1661" href="#Footnote_1661" class="fnanchor">[1661]</a> St. Denis the Carthusian,
commenting on this passage, says, that she has been
called a lily among thorns because all other virgins
were thorns either to themselves or others; but
the blessed Virgin has never been one to herself or
others.<a id="FNanchor_1662" href="#Footnote_1662" class="fnanchor">[1662]</a> For by her presence alone she infused into
all, thoughts and affections of purity: “Intuentium
corda ad castitatem invitabat.”<a id="FNanchor_1663" href="#Footnote_1663" class="fnanchor">[1663]</a> And this is confirmed
by St. Thomas, who says that the beauty of the
blessed Virgin encouraged chastity in all who beheld
her: “Pulchritudo B. Virginis intuentes ad castitatem
excitabat.”<a id="FNanchor_1664" href="#Footnote_1664" class="fnanchor">[1664]</a> St. Jerome declares himself of the opinion
that St. Joseph preserved his virginity by the society
of Mary, for the saint thus writes against the
heretic Helvidius, who denied the virginity of Mary:
Thou sayest that Mary did not remain a virgin; I take
it upon myself to maintain more than that, even that
Joseph himself preserved his virginity through Mary.<a id="FNanchor_1665" href="#Footnote_1665" class="fnanchor">[1665]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_626"></a>[626]</span>
A certain author says that the blessed Virgin so loved
this virtue, that to preserve it, she would have been
ready to renounce even the dignity of mother of God.
This we may learn from her own answer to the archangel:
“How shall this be done, because I know not
man?”<a id="FNanchor_1666" href="#Footnote_1666" class="fnanchor">[1666]</a> and from the words she afterwards added:
Be it done to me according to thy word: “Fiat mihi
secundum verbum tuum;” signifying by this that she
gave her consent on the condition of which the angel
had assured her, namely, that she should become a
mother by means of the Holy Spirit alone.</p>

<p>St. Ambrose says: He who has preserved chastity
is an angel, he who has lost it is a devil.<a id="FNanchor_1667" href="#Footnote_1667" class="fnanchor">[1667]</a> According
to the words of our Lord: “They shall be as the angels
of God in heaven.”<a id="FNanchor_1668" href="#Footnote_1668" class="fnanchor">[1668]</a> But the unchaste become
odious to God as the devils. And St. Remigius said
that the greater number of adults are lost through this
vice. The victory over this vice is rare, as has been
said in the words of St. Augustine at the beginning of
this section; but why is it rare? Because the means
for conquering it are not put in use. The means are
three according to Bellarmine, and the masters of the
spiritual life: Fasting, avoiding dangerous occasions,
and prayer: “Jejuniun, periculorum evitatio, et oratio.”
By fasting is meant mortification, particularly of the
eyes and of the appetite. The most holy Mary, although<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_627"></a>[627]</span>
she was full of divine grace, was so mortified
with her eyes that she kept them always cast down,
as St. Epiphanius and St. John Damascene inform us,
and never fixed them on any one; they say that from
her childhood she was so modest that she was the
wonder of all. And hence St. Luke remarks, that in
going to visit St. Elizabeth: She went with haste:
“Abiit cum festinatione,” that she might not be long
seen in public. Philibert relates with regard to her
food, that it was revealed to a hermit named Felix, that
the infant Mary took milk only once a day. And St.
Gregory of Tours asserts that, during her whole life,
she fasted always: “Nullo tempore Maria non jejunavit;”
and St. Bonaventure adds, that Mary would
never have found so much grace unless she had been
temperate in food, for grace and gluttony cannot subsist
together.<a id="FNanchor_1669" href="#Footnote_1669" class="fnanchor">[1669]</a> In a word, Mary practised mortification
in every thing, so that of her it was said: My
hands dropped with myrrh: “Manus meæ stillaverunt
myrrham.”<a id="FNanchor_1670" href="#Footnote_1670" class="fnanchor">[1670]</a></p>

<p>The second means is to fly the occasions of sin.
He that is aware of the snares shall be secure: “Qui
autem cavet laqueos, securus erit.”<a id="FNanchor_1671" href="#Footnote_1671" class="fnanchor">[1671]</a> Hence St. Philip
Neri said, that in this warfare cowards conquer; that
is, those who avoid dangerous occasions. Mary
shunned as much as possible the sight of men; and
therefore St. Luke says that in her visit to St. Elizabeth,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_628"></a>[628]</span>
she went with haste into the hill country:
“Abiit in montana cum festinatione.” And a certain
author remarks that the Virgin left Elizabeth before
the birth of the Baptist, as we learn from the Gospel
itself, in which it is said that “Mary abode with her
about three months; and she returned to her own
house. Now Elizabeth’s full time of being delivered
was come, and she brought forth a son.”<a id="FNanchor_1672" href="#Footnote_1672" class="fnanchor">[1672]</a> And why
did she not wait till his birth? In order to avoid the
conversation and visits which would follow that event.
The third means is prayer. “And as I knew,” said
the wise man, “that I could not otherwise be continent
except God gave it.... I went to the Lord and
besought him.”<a id="FNanchor_1673" href="#Footnote_1673" class="fnanchor">[1673]</a> And the blessed Virgin revealed to
St. Elisabeth, a Benedictine nun, that she had not acquired
any virtue without effort and continual prayer.<a id="FNanchor_1674" href="#Footnote_1674" class="fnanchor">[1674]</a>
St. John Damascene says that Mary is pure and a
lover of purity: “Pura est et puritatem amans,” and
therefore she cannot endure the impure. But whoever
has recourse to her will certainly be delivered
from this vice by only pronouncing her name with
confidence. And the venerable John of Avila says
that many temptations against chastity have been
overcome solely by devotion to the immaculate Virgin.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_629"></a>[629]</span>
Oh Mary, oh most pure dove, how many are in hell
through the vice of impurity! Oh Lady, obtain for
us that always in our temptations we may have recourse
to thee, and invoke thee, saying: Mary, Mary,
help us. Amen.</p>

<h4 id="SECTION_VII">SECTION VII.<br>
ON THE POVERTY OF MARY.</h4>

<p>Our loving Redeemer chose to be poor on this
earth in order to teach us to despise the goods of this
world: “Being rich,” says St. Paul, “he became poor
for your sake, that through his poverty you might be
rich.”<a id="FNanchor_1675" href="#Footnote_1675" class="fnanchor">[1675]</a> For this reason Jesus Christ says to each one
who wishes to be his disciple: “If thou wilt be perfect,
go sell what thou hast and give it to the poor,
and come follow me.”<a id="FNanchor_1676" href="#Footnote_1676" class="fnanchor">[1676]</a> Behold his most perfect disciple
Mary, who indeed imitated his example. Father
Canisius proves that the holy Virgin could have lived
in comfort on the inheritance left her by her parents,
but she was content to remain poor, reserving to herself
a small portion, and giving the rest in alms to the
temple and to the poor. Many are of opinion that
Mary also made a vow of poverty,<a id="FNanchor_1677" href="#Footnote_1677" class="fnanchor">[1677]</a> and it is known<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_630"></a>[630]</span>
that she herself said to St. Bridget: “From the beginning
I vowed in my heart never to possess any
thing in the world.”<a id="FNanchor_1678" href="#Footnote_1678" class="fnanchor">[1678]</a> The gifts received from the
holy Magi were certainly not of small value, but St.
Bernard attests that she distributed them all to the
poor.<a id="FNanchor_1679" href="#Footnote_1679" class="fnanchor">[1679]</a> And we learn that the divine mother immediately
gave to others the presents above mentioned,
from the fact that when she went to the temple she
did not offer the lamb, which was the oblation made
by those who were able, as we read in Leviticus:
“For a son she shall bring a lamb,”<a id="FNanchor_1680" href="#Footnote_1680" class="fnanchor">[1680]</a> ... but she
offered two turtle-doves and two young pigeons, the
oblation of the poor: “And to offer a sacrifice, according
as it is written in the law of the Lord, a pair
of turtle-doves or two young pigeons.”<a id="FNanchor_1681" href="#Footnote_1681" class="fnanchor">[1681]</a> Mary herself
said to St. Bridget: “All that I had I gave to the
poor, and kept nothing for myself but poor food and
clothing.”<a id="FNanchor_1682" href="#Footnote_1682" class="fnanchor">[1682]</a></p>

<p>Through love of poverty she did not disdain to
marry a poor carpenter, like St. Joseph, and afterwards,
as St. Bonaventure relates, to support herself<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_631"></a>[631]</span>
by the work of her hands, as sewing or spinning. An
angel revealed to St. Bridget concerning Mary, that
worldly riches were in her eyes vile as dirt: “Mundanæ
divitæ velut lutum sibi vilescebat.” In a word,
she always lived in poverty, and she died in poverty;
for as Metaphrastes and Nicephorus relate, she left
nothing behind her at her death but two poor garments
to two women, who had assisted her during
life.<a id="FNanchor_1683" href="#Footnote_1683" class="fnanchor">[1683]</a></p>

<p>He who loves riches, said St. Philip Neri, will never
become a saint; and St. Theresa also said: It justly
follows that he who goes in search of things lost is
also lost. On the other hand, the same saint said,
that this virtue of poverty is a good that comprises all
other goods. I have said the virtue of poverty which,
according to St. Bernard, does not consist alone in
being poor, but in loving poverty: “Non paupertas,
sed amor paupertatis virtus est.” Therefore Jesus
Christ has said: “Blessed are the poor in spirit, for
theirs is the kingdom of heaven.”<a id="FNanchor_1684" href="#Footnote_1684" class="fnanchor">[1684]</a> Blessed, because
they who wish for nothing but God, in God find every
good, and find in poverty their paradise on earth, as
St. Francis found it in saying: My God and my all:
“Deus meus et omnia.” Let us, then, according to
the exhortation of St. Augustine, love that only good
in which is every good: “Ama unum bonum, in quo
sunt omnia bona.” And let us pray our Lord with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_632"></a>[632]</span>
St. Ignatius: Give me only thy love together with
thy grace, and I am rich enough.<a id="FNanchor_1685" href="#Footnote_1685" class="fnanchor">[1685]</a> And when poverty
afflicts us, let us console ourselves by the thought
that Jesus and his mother have also been poor
like us.<a id="FNanchor_1686" href="#Footnote_1686" class="fnanchor">[1686]</a></p>

<p>Ah, my most holy mother, thou hadst in truth reason
to say, that in God was thy joy: “And my spirit
hath rejoiced in God my Saviour,”<a id="FNanchor_1687" href="#Footnote_1687" class="fnanchor">[1687]</a> for in this world
thou didst not desire nor love any other good than
God. Draw me after thee: “Trahe me post te.”
Oh Lady! detach me from the world, and draw me
after thee to love that one who alone merits to be
loved. Amen.</p>

<h4 id="SECTION_VIII">SECTION VIII.<br>
OF THE OBEDIENCE OF MARY.</h4>

<p>It was through the affection which Mary bore to
the virtue of obedience, that when the annunciation
was made to her by St. Gabriel, she did not wish to
call herself by any other name than that of handmaid:
Behold the handmaid of the Lord: “Ecce ancilla
Domini.” Indeed, says St. Thomas of Villanova, this
faithful handmaid neither in act, word, nor thought,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_633"></a>[633]</span>
ever disobeyed the Lord, but, divested of all self-will,
she always, and in all things, lived obedient to
the divine will.<a id="FNanchor_1688" href="#Footnote_1688" class="fnanchor">[1688]</a> She herself declared that God
was pleased with her obedience when she said: He
regarded the humility of his handmaid: “Respexit
humilitatem ancillæ suæ;”<a id="FNanchor_1689" href="#Footnote_1689" class="fnanchor">[1689]</a> for this is the humility of
a servant, to be always prompt to obey. St. Augustine
says, that the divine mother remedied by her
obedience the evil that Eve had caused by her disobedience.<a id="FNanchor_1690" href="#Footnote_1690" class="fnanchor">[1690]</a>
The obedience of Mary was far more
perfect than that of all the other saints, for all men
being inclined to evil through original sin, they all feel
difficulty in doing right; but not so the blessed Virgin;
for as St. Bernardine says: Because she was free
from original sin, there was in her no hindrance in
obeying God, but she was like a wheel readily moved
at every divine breath;<a id="FNanchor_1691" href="#Footnote_1691" class="fnanchor">[1691]</a> hence her only occupation
on this earth, as the same saint expresses it, was
to discover and do what was pleasing to God.<a id="FNanchor_1692" href="#Footnote_1692" class="fnanchor">[1692]</a> Of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_634"></a>[634]</span>
her it was said: My soul melted when he spoke:
“Anima mea liquefacta est, ut dilectus meus locutus
est.”<a id="FNanchor_1693" href="#Footnote_1693" class="fnanchor">[1693]</a> Commenting on this passage, Richard says
that the soul of Mary was like metal in a state of fusion,
ready to take any form that was pleasing to
God.<a id="FNanchor_1694" href="#Footnote_1694" class="fnanchor">[1694]</a></p>

<p>Mary proved indeed the readiness of her obedience,
in the first place, when, in order to please God, she
was willing even to obey the Roman emperor, and made
the journey, fifty miles, to Bethlehem, in winter, being
pregnant, and so poor that she was obliged to bring
forth her Son in a stable. She was also ready at the
notice of St. Joseph, to set out immediately on that
very night upon the longer and more difficult journey
into Egypt. And Silveira asks why the command to
fly into Egypt was given to St. Joseph and not to the
blessed Virgin, who was to suffer the most from the
journey? And he answers: Lest the Virgin should
be deprived of an opportunity for performing an act
of obedience for which she was most ready.<a id="FNanchor_1695" href="#Footnote_1695" class="fnanchor">[1695]</a> But
above all, she showed her heroic obedience, when, in
order to obey the divine will, she offered her Son to
death with so much firmness that, as St. Ildephonsus
says, she would have been ready to crucify him, if<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_635"></a>[635]</span>
executioners had been wanting.<a id="FNanchor_1696" href="#Footnote_1696" class="fnanchor">[1696]</a> Hence the venerable
Bede, commenting on those words of the Redeemer
to that woman in the Gospel who exclaimed: “Blessed
is the womb that bore thee:” “Yea, rather, blessed
are they who hear the Word of God and keep it,”<a id="FNanchor_1697" href="#Footnote_1697" class="fnanchor">[1697]</a>
says, that Mary was more happy through obedience
to the divine will, than in being the mother of God
himself.<a id="FNanchor_1698" href="#Footnote_1698" class="fnanchor">[1698]</a></p>

<p>For this reason it is, that those who love obedience
are very pleasing to the Virgin. She appeared once
to a religious, a Franciscan, named Accorso, in his cell,
who being called by obedience to go and hear the confession
of a sick person, went out, but when he returned
he found Mary waiting for him, and she greatly
praised his obedience. As, on the other hand, she
greatly blamed another religious, who, when the bell
had summoned him to the refectory, delayed in order
to finish certain devotions.<a id="FNanchor_1699" href="#Footnote_1699" class="fnanchor">[1699]</a> The Virgin, speaking to
St. Bridget of the security found in obeying a spiritual
father, said: Obedience has brought all the saints to
glory: “Obedientia omnes introducit ad gloriam.”<a id="FNanchor_1700" href="#Footnote_1700" class="fnanchor">[1700]</a> St.
Philip Neri also says, that God requires no account
of things done in obedience, having himself declared:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_636"></a>[636]</span>
“He that heareth you, heareth me; and he that despiseth
you, despiseth me.”<a id="FNanchor_1701" href="#Footnote_1701" class="fnanchor">[1701]</a> The mother of God
herself revealed to St. Bridget, that through the merit
of her obedience she had obtained from the Lord that
all penitent sinners who have recourse to her, should
be pardoned.<a id="FNanchor_1702" href="#Footnote_1702" class="fnanchor">[1702]</a> Ah, our queen and mother, pray Jesus
for us, obtain for us through the merit of thy
obedience that we may be faithful in obeying his will,
and the commands of our spiritual fathers. Amen.</p>

<h4 id="SECTION_IX">SECTION IX.<br>
OF THE PATIENCE OF MARY.</h4>

<p>Since this earth is a place of merit, it is justly
called a valley of tears; for we are all placed here to
suffer, and by patience to obtain for our souls eternal
life: “In your patience you shall possess your souls,”<a id="FNanchor_1703" href="#Footnote_1703" class="fnanchor">[1703]</a>
said our Lord. God gave us the Virgin Mary as an
example of all virtues, but especially as an example
of patience. St. Francis of Sales, among other things,
remarks, that at the nuptials of Cana Jesus Christ
gave an answer to the most holy Virgin, by which he
seemed to pay but little regard to her prayers: Woman,
what is that to thee and to me? “Quid mihi et<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_637"></a>[637]</span>
tibi est, mulier?” precisely for this reason, that he
might give us an example of the patience of his holy
mother. But why seek further? The whole life of
Mary was a continual exercise of patience, for, as an
angel revealed to St. Bridget, the blessed Virgin lived
always in the midst of sufferings.<a id="FNanchor_1704" href="#Footnote_1704" class="fnanchor">[1704]</a> Her compassion
alone for the sufferings of the Redeemer was enough
to make her a martyr of patience; wherefore St. Bonaventure
says: The crucified conceived the crucified:
“Crucifixa crucifixum concepit.” When we spoke of
her dolors, we considered all she suffered, as well in
her journey and life in Egypt, as during the whole
time she lived with her Son in the workshop of Nazareth.
But the presence of Mary on Calvary, with her
dying Jesus, is alone enough to show us how constant
and sublime was her patience: There stood by the
cross of Jesus, his mother: “Stabat juxta crucem
Jesu mater ejus.” Then, by the merit of this her
patience, as blessed Albertus Magnus remarks, she
became our mother, and brought us forth to the life
of grace.<a id="FNanchor_1705" href="#Footnote_1705" class="fnanchor">[1705]</a></p>

<p>If we desire then to be the children of Mary, we
must seek to imitate her patience. And what, says
St. Cyprian, can enrich us more with merit in this life,
and glory in the other, than bearing sufferings with
patience?<a id="FNanchor_1706" href="#Footnote_1706" class="fnanchor">[1706]</a> God said by the mouth of the prophet<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_638"></a>[638]</span>
Osee: I will hedge up thy way with thorns: “Sepiam
viam tuam spinis.”<a id="FNanchor_1707" href="#Footnote_1707" class="fnanchor">[1707]</a> St. Gregory remarks on this
passage, that the ways of the elect are hedged with
thorns: “Electorum viæ spinis sepiuntur.” For as a
hedge of thorns protects the vine, so God encompasses
his servants with tribulation, in order that they may not
become attached to the earth; therefore St. Cyprian
concludes, patience delivers us from sin and from hell:
“Patientia nos servat.” And it is patience that makes
the saints: “Patience hath a perfect work,”<a id="FNanchor_1708" href="#Footnote_1708" class="fnanchor">[1708]</a> bearing
in peace the crosses that come to us directly from
God, as sickness, poverty, &amp;c., as well as those that
come to us from men, such as persecutions, injuries,
&amp;c. St. John saw all the saints with palms, the emblem
of martyrdom, in their hands. “After this I
saw a great multitude ... and palms were in their
hands;”<a id="FNanchor_1709" href="#Footnote_1709" class="fnanchor">[1709]</a> signifying by this that all men must be
martyrs by the sword, or by patience. Be then joyful,
exclaims St. Gregory: We can be martyrs without
blood, if we preserve patience.<a id="FNanchor_1710" href="#Footnote_1710" class="fnanchor">[1710]</a> If we suffer the
afflictions of this life, as St. Bernard says, patiently
and joyfully: “Patienter, et gaudenter,” oh, how much
every pain endured for God will obtain for us in heaven!
Hence the apostle encourages us in these words:
“Our tribulation, which is momentary and light, worketh<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_639"></a>[639]</span>
for us ... an eternal weight of glory.”<a id="FNanchor_1711" href="#Footnote_1711" class="fnanchor">[1711]</a> Beautiful
are the instructions of St. Theresa on this subject:
“He who embraces the cross,” she says, “does not feel
it.” And again: “When a person resolves to suffer, the
pain is over.” And if we feel our crosses heavy, let us
have recourse to Mary, who is called by the Church:
The comforter of the afflicted: “Consolatrix afflictorum;”
and by St. John Damascene: The remedy for
all sorrows of the heart: “Omnium dolorum cordium
medicamentum.” Ah, my most sweet Lady, thou,
though innocent, didst suffer with so much patience,
and shall I, who am deserving of hell, refuse to suffer?
My mother, to-day I ask of thee the grace not to be
exempt from crosses, but to support them with patience.
For the love of Jesus I pray thee to obtain
for me nothing less than this grace from God; through
you I hope for it.</p>

<h4 id="SECTION_X">SECTION X.<br>
OF THE PRAYER OF MARY.</h4>

<p>No soul on this earth has ever followed so perfectly
as the blessed Virgin that great lesson of our Saviour:
We ought always to pray, and not to faint: “Oportet
semper orare, et non deficere.”<a id="FNanchor_1712" href="#Footnote_1712" class="fnanchor">[1712]</a> From no other, says
St. Bonaventure, can we better take example, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_640"></a>[640]</span>
learn the necessity of persevering in prayer, than from
Mary. Mary gave an example, that we ought to follow
and not faint.<a id="FNanchor_1713" href="#Footnote_1713" class="fnanchor">[1713]</a> For the blessed Albertus Magnus
asserts, that after Jesus Christ, the divine mother
was the most perfect in the virtue of prayer, of all
who ever have lived or ever will live: “Virtus orationis
in B. Virgine excellentissima fuit.”<a id="FNanchor_1714" href="#Footnote_1714" class="fnanchor">[1714]</a> First, because
her prayer was continual and persevering. From
the first moment in which she had life, and with life
the perfect use of reason, as we have said above in
the Discourse on her Nativity, she began to pray.
And, moreover, that she might devote herself more
to prayer, she wished, when a child of only three
years, to shut herself up in the retirement of the
temple; where, as she herself revealed to St. Elizabeth
(virgin), among the other hours that she allotted
to prayer, she was accustomed to rise at midnight
and go to pray before the altar of the temple.<a id="FNanchor_1715" href="#Footnote_1715" class="fnanchor">[1715]</a>
And, in order to meditate on the sufferings
of Jesus, according to Odilone, she also frequently
visited the places of our Lord’s nativity, passion,
and burial.<a id="FNanchor_1716" href="#Footnote_1716" class="fnanchor">[1716]</a> Moreover, her prayer, as St. Denis
the Carthusian has written, was wholly recollected,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_641"></a>[641]</span>
free from all distractions, and every irregular inclination.<a id="FNanchor_1717" href="#Footnote_1717" class="fnanchor">[1717]</a></p>

<p>Therefore the blessed Virgin, through her love of
prayer, had so great a love of solitude, that, as she
said to St. Bridget, when she lived in the temple she
even abstained from intercourse with her holy parents.
St. Jerome, meditating on the words of Isaias—“Behold
a Virgin shall conceive and bear a Son, and his
name shall be called Emmanuel”<a id="FNanchor_1718" href="#Footnote_1718" class="fnanchor">[1718]</a>—says, that in
Hebrew the word <i>virgin</i> properly signifies <i>a retired
virgin</i>; so that Mary’s love of solitude was already
predicted by the prophet. Richard says that the
angel addressed her in the words, The Lord is with
thee: “Dominus tecum,” on account of her great love
of solitude.<a id="FNanchor_1719" href="#Footnote_1719" class="fnanchor">[1719]</a> And St. Vincent Ferrer asserts that
the divine mother never went from home, except to
go to the temple, and then she went entirely recollected,
having her eyes always cast down.<a id="FNanchor_1720" href="#Footnote_1720" class="fnanchor">[1720]</a> When
going to visit St. Elizabeth, she went with haste:
“Abiit cum festinatione;” and from this St. Ambrose
says virgins should learn to shun the public eye. St.
Bernard teaches that Mary, through her love of prayer<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_642"></a>[642]</span>
and solitude, was always careful to avoid conversation
with men.<a id="FNanchor_1721" href="#Footnote_1721" class="fnanchor">[1721]</a> Hence she is called by the Holy Spirit
the turtle-dove: Thy cheeks are beautiful as the turtle-dove’s:
“Pulchræ sunt genæ tuæ sicut turturis.”<a id="FNanchor_1722" href="#Footnote_1722" class="fnanchor">[1722]</a>
Which words Vergellus thus explains: The turtle-dove
is a lover of solitude, and is an emblem of the
unitive power of the soul.<a id="FNanchor_1723" href="#Footnote_1723" class="fnanchor">[1723]</a> So the Virgin always
lived solitary in this world, as in a desert, and therefore
it was said of her: Who is this that goeth up by
the desert, as a pillar of smoke? “Quæ est ista quæ
ascendit per desertum, sicut virgula fumi?”<a id="FNanchor_1724" href="#Footnote_1724" class="fnanchor">[1724]</a> On
which words Rupert the Abbot says: Thus thou didst
ascend by the desert, having a solitary soul: “Talis
ascendisti per desertum animam habens solitariam.”</p>

<p>Philo said that God speaks to souls only in solitude:
“Dei sermo amat deserta.” And God himself declared
this by the prophet Osee, when he said: I will
lead her into the wilderness, and I will speak to her
heart: “Ducam eam in solitudinem, et loquar ad cor
ejus.”<a id="FNanchor_1725" href="#Footnote_1725" class="fnanchor">[1725]</a> And hence St. Jerome exclaims: Oh solitude,
in which God familiarly converses with his servants!<a id="FNanchor_1726" href="#Footnote_1726" class="fnanchor">[1726]</a>
Yes, says St. Bernard, because the quiet and the silence
that is enjoyed in solitude, force the soul to leave the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_643"></a>[643]</span>
earth in thought, and to meditate on the things of
heaven.<a id="FNanchor_1727" href="#Footnote_1727" class="fnanchor">[1727]</a> Oh, most holy Virgin, obtain for us a love
of prayer and solitude, that detaching ourselves from
the love of creatures, we may aspire only after God
and heaven, where we hope one day to see thee, to
praise and love with thee thy Son, Jesus, forever and
ever. Amen. “Come over to me, all ye that desire
me, and be filled with my fruits.”<a id="FNanchor_1728" href="#Footnote_1728" class="fnanchor">[1728]</a> The fruits of
Mary are her virtues.</p>

<p>None has appeared like unto thee, in all time before
or after thee.<a id="FNanchor_1729" href="#Footnote_1729" class="fnanchor">[1729]</a></p>

<p>Thou alone, oh woman without equal, hast been
pleasing to Christ.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" id="VARIOUS_PRACTICES_OF_DEVOTION_TO_THE_DIVINE_MOTHER">VARIOUS PRACTICES OF DEVOTION TO THE DIVINE MOTHER.</h4>

</div>

<p>The queen of heaven is so liberal, as St. Andrew
of Crete says, that she makes a large return for the
smallest devotions of her servants.<a id="FNanchor_1730" href="#Footnote_1730" class="fnanchor">[1730]</a> But two conditions
are necessary for this: First, that we offer her
the homage of a soul pure from sin; for otherwise
Mary will say to us what she said to a soldier, a man<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_644"></a>[644]</span>
of vicious habits, who, as St. Peter Celestine relates,<a id="FNanchor_1731" href="#Footnote_1731" class="fnanchor">[1731]</a>
offered every day a devotion to the Virgin. One day
when he was suffering greatly from hunger, our Lady
appeared to him, and presented him some exquisite
viands, but in a vase so filthy that he did not venture
to taste them. “I am the mother of God,” Mary then
said to him, “who has come to relieve thy hunger.”
“But I cannot taste from this vase,” answered the
soldier. “And do you wish,” replied Mary, “that I
should accept thy devotions, offered me from a soul
so polluted?” The soldier, at these words, was converted,
became a hermit, lived thirty years in the
desert, and at death the Virgin again appeared to him
and conducted him to heaven. We have said, in the
first part of this work, that morally speaking it was
impossible that a servant of Mary should be lost. But
this must be understood with the condition, that he
lives without sin, or at least that he wishes to abandon
it, for then our Lady will assist him. But if any
one, on the other hand, should sin, in the hope that
our Lady will save him, he would by his sin render
himself unworthy and incapable of the protection of
Mary. The second condition is, that he perseveres in
his devotion to Mary. Perseverance alone shall merit
a crown, says St. Bernard: “Perseverantia sola meretur
coronam.”<a id="FNanchor_1732" href="#Footnote_1732" class="fnanchor">[1732]</a> Thomas à Kempis, when a young
man, was accustomed daily to have recourse to the
Virgin with certain prayers; one day he omitted them,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_645"></a>[645]</span>
then he omitted them for some weeks, then he gave
them up entirely. One night he saw Mary in a dream,
who embraced his companions, but having come to
him, said: “What do you expect, who have given up
your devotions? Depart, for you are unworthy of
my favors.” Terrified by these words, Thomas awoke,
and resumed his accustomed prayers. Richard therefore
with reason says: He who is perseveringly devoted
to Mary will be blessed with the hope, that all
his desires may be gratified.<a id="FNanchor_1733" href="#Footnote_1733" class="fnanchor">[1733]</a> But as no one can be
secure of this perseverance, no one can be sure of
salvation before his death. It was a very remarkable
document which brother John Berchmans, of the
Company of Jesus, gave to his companions, when he
was requested by them to leave with them in writing,
what was the most pleasing devotion which they could
make to our Lady, in order to obtain her protection,
and he answered: Any small thing, but let it be constant:
“Quidquid minimum, dum modo sit constans.”
Finally, however, I add here, simply and in a few
words, the different devotions we may offer to our
mother, to obtain for us her favor; a thing which I
consider the most useful that I have written in this
little work. But I do not so much recommend to my
reader to practise them all, as to practise those which
he selects, with perseverance, and in fear of losing the
protection of the divine mother, if he neglects to continue
them. Oh, how many who are in hell would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_646"></a>[646]</span>
have been saved, if they had continued the devotions
which they once commenced to Mary!</p>

<h5>DEVOTION I.—OF THE “HAIL MARY.”</h5>

<p>This angelical salutation is very pleasing to the
most holy Virgin, for it seems to renew, as it were,
the joy which she experienced, when St. Gabriel announced
to her that she was made mother of God;
and therefore we should often salute her with the
“Hail Mary.” Salute her with the angelical salutation,
says Thomas à Kempis, for gladly does she hear
this sound.<a id="FNanchor_1734" href="#Footnote_1734" class="fnanchor">[1734]</a> The divine mother herself said to St.
Matilda, that no one could better salute her than with
the “Hail Mary.” He who salutes Mary will also be
saluted by her. St. Bernard heard himself once
audibly saluted from a statue of the Virgin, which said
to him, Hail Bernard: “Ave Bernarde.”<a id="FNanchor_1735" href="#Footnote_1735" class="fnanchor">[1735]</a> And the
salutation of Mary, says St. Bonaventure, will be
some grace, whereby she always responds to those
who salute her.<a id="FNanchor_1736" href="#Footnote_1736" class="fnanchor">[1736]</a> And Richard adds: If any one
comes to the mother of our Lord saying, “Hail Mary,”
could she deny him the favor he asks?<a id="FNanchor_1737" href="#Footnote_1737" class="fnanchor">[1737]</a> Mary herself
promised St. Gertrude help in death for every<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_647"></a>[647]</span>
“Hail Mary” she said. The blessed Alanus asserts,
that as all heaven rejoices when a “Hail Mary” is said,
so the devil trembles and flees: “Cœlum gaudet,
Satan fugit, cum dico, Ave Maria.” Which Thomas
à Kempis also confirms, for a devil who once appeared
to him suddenly fled at hearing the “Hail Mary.”<a id="FNanchor_1738" href="#Footnote_1738" class="fnanchor">[1738]</a></p>

<p>The practice of this devotion is:—1st. To say every
morning on rising, and every evening on going to bed,
three “Hail Marys,” prostrate, or at least kneeling;
adding at each that short prayer: “By thy pure
and immaculate conception, oh Mary! make my body
pure, and my soul holy.” To ask the blessing of
Mary as our mother, as St. Stanislas always did,
and place ourselves under the mantle of our Lady,
praying her that during the following day or night she
may keep us from sin. And it is a great help to this,
to keep near the bed a beautiful image of the Virgin.
2d. To say the Angelus, &amp;c., with the three “Hail
Marys” as usual, in the morning, at noon, and in the
evening. John XXII. was the first Pope who attached
an indulgence to this devotion, on the occasion, as
Father Crasset relates,<a id="FNanchor_1739" href="#Footnote_1739" class="fnanchor">[1739]</a> when a criminal who was condemned
to be burned, by invoking Mary on the Vigil
of her Annunciation remained uninjured, even to his
garments, in the midst of the flames. Benedict XIII.
at length granted a hundred days’ indulgence to those
who recite it, and at the end of the month a plenary
indulgence, having made their confession and received
holy communion. Father Crasset also states that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_648"></a>[648]</span>
there have been other indulgences granted by Clement
X. to those who at the end of each “Hail Mary”
add: Thanks be to God and Mary: “Deo gratias et
Mariæ.”<a id="FNanchor_1740" href="#Footnote_1740" class="fnanchor">[1740]</a> Formerly, at the sound of the bell, every
one knelt to say the Angelus; now some are ashamed
to do so; but St. Charles Borromeo was not ashamed
to descend from his carriage or horse, to recite it in
the street, and sometimes even in the mud. It is related
that a certain indolent religious, who would not
kneel at the signal for the “Hail Mary,” saw the belfry
bow three times, and a voice spoke from it which
said: Behold, thou wilt not do what even senseless
creatures do. Let it be remembered, that as Benedict
XIV. directed, in the Paschal season, instead of
the Angelus the “Regina Cœli” is said. And from
Vespers on Saturday, through the whole of Sunday,
the Angelus Domini is said standing. 3d. To salute
the mother of God with a “Hail Mary,” every time
the clock strikes. Alphonsus Rodriguez saluted Mary
every hour, and in the night when the hour came, the
angels awoke him, that he might not omit this devotion.
4th. On quitting and entering the house, to
salute the Virgin with a “Hail Mary,” that at home
and abroad she may protect us from sin, and to kiss
her feet as the Carthusian Fathers are accustomed to
do. 5th. To pay reverence with a “Hail Mary” to
every image of Mary which we meet, and let every
one who can do so, place some beautiful image of the
Virgin in a niche in the walls of his house, that it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_649"></a>[649]</span>
may be honored by those who are passing by. In
Naples, and still more in Rome, there are very beautiful
images of our Lady, by the wayside, placed
there by her devout servants. 6th. The holy Church
directs that the angelical salutation be prefixed to all
the canonical hours of the office, and that the office
should terminate with it; hence it is well, at the beginning
and end of every action, always to say a “Hail
Mary;” I say of every action, whether it be spiritual,
as prayer, confession, communion, spiritual reading,
hearing a sermon, &amp;c.; or temporal, as study, giving
counsel, labor, going to table, to bed, &amp;c. Happy
are those actions that are inclosed between two “Hail
Marys!” And thus also on awaking in the morning,
on closing the eyes to sleep, in every temptation and
peril, in every burst of anger, &amp;c., say always a “Hail
Mary.” My dear reader, practise this, and you will
see the advantage to be drawn from it; remembering
that for every “Hail Mary” there are twenty
days’ indulgence.<a id="FNanchor_1741" href="#Footnote_1741" class="fnanchor">[1741]</a> Moreover, Father Auriemma relates,<a id="FNanchor_1742" href="#Footnote_1742" class="fnanchor">[1742]</a>
that the blessed Virgin promised St. Matilda a
good death, if she recited every day three “Hail
Marys” in honor of her power, wisdom, and goodness.
And she also said to blessed Jane of France, that the
“Hail Mary” was very pleasing to her, especially
when said ten times in honor of her ten virtues.<a id="FNanchor_1743" href="#Footnote_1743" class="fnanchor">[1743]</a>
Many indulgences are also attached to these ten “Hail
Marys.”</p>

<h5>DEVOTION II.—OF NOVENAS.</h5>

<p>The servants of Mary are very attentive and fervent
in celebrating the Novenas of her Feasts; and during
these the holy Virgin, full of love, dispenses to them
innumerable and special blessings. One day St. Gertrude
saw under the mantle of Mary innumerable souls,
whom our Lady was looking upon with great affection,
and she understood them to be those who, on preceding
days, had prepared themselves, by devout exercises, for
the feast of the Assumption. The devotions to be used
for the Novenas are the following: 1st. Mental prayer,
morning and evening, with a visit to the most holy
Sacrament, with the addition of an “Our Father,”
“Hail Mary,” and “Glory be to the Father, &amp;c.,” repeated
nine times. 2d. Three visits to some image of
Mary, thanking the Lord for the graces granted to
her, and asking of the Virgin every time some special
favor; and at one of these visits the prayer which is
placed at the end of each of her feasts should be read.
3d. Make many acts of love, at least one hundred, or
fifty, to Mary and to Jesus, for we can do nothing
more pleasing to her, as she said to St. Bridget, than
to love her Son: If you wish to become dear to me,
love my Son Jesus: “Si te mihi vis devincire, ama
filium meum Jesum.” 4th. Read every day of the
Novena, for a quarter of an hour, some book which
treats of her glories. 5th. Make some external mortification
of hair-cloth, discipline, &amp;c., with fasting, or
some abstinence at table from fruits or other agreeable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_651"></a>[651]</span>
food, at least in part; chewing also some bitter herb:
and on the vigil of the feast fast on bread and water.
But all this must be done always with the permission
of a spiritual Father. But better than all others are
the practices in these Novenas of internal mortifications,
as abstaining from the indulgence of curiosity, either
through the eye or the ear; remaining retired and silent;
obeying, not answering with impatience; bearing
contradictions, and other things of the sort, which
may be used with less danger of vainglory and greater
merit; and for these, too, the permission of a director
is not needed. The most useful exercise is to propose,
at the beginning, the amending of some fault
into which we are most liable to fall. And to this
end it is well, at each of the visits above named, to
ask pardon for some past sin, renew the intention of
avoiding it in future, and implore the help of Mary
in keeping this resolution. The honor most dear to
the Virgin is the imitation of her virtues; wherefore it
is well in every Novena to propose to one’s self some
special virtue of Mary, particularly adapted to the
mystery; as for example, on the feast of the Conception,
purity of intention; of her Nativity, the renewing
of the spirit and the awakening from tepidity; of her
Presentation, detachment from something to which
we are most attached; of the Annunciation, humility
in bearing contempt, &amp;c.; of the Visitation, charity
towards the neighbor, alms-giving, &amp;c., or at least, the
praying for sinners; of the Purification, obedience to
superiors; and finally, of the Assumption, the practice<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_652"></a>[652]</span>
of detachment, and doing all things as a preparation
for death, living as if every day were to be the last.
In this way the Novena will prove of great service.
6th. Besides the communion on the day of the feast,
it is well to ask it more frequently of the spiritual
father on the days of the Novena. Father Segneri
said that we cannot honor Mary better than with Jesus.
For she herself, as Father Crasset relates,<a id="FNanchor_1744" href="#Footnote_1744" class="fnanchor">[1744]</a> revealed
to a holy soul that nothing dearer could be
offered to her than the holy communion, for there
Jesus Christ gathers in the soul the fruit of his passion.
Hence it appears that the Virgin desires nothing
from her servants more than the holy communion, saying:
“Come, eat the bread and drink the wine that I
have prepared for you.”<a id="FNanchor_1745" href="#Footnote_1745" class="fnanchor">[1745]</a> Finally, on the day of the
feast after communion we should offer ourselves for
the service of this divine mother by asking of her the
grace of the virtue proposed in the Novena, or some
other special favor. And it is well every year to set
apart among others some feasts of the Virgin, to which
we have the greatest devotion and tenderness, and
make a particular preparation for this by dedicating
ourselves anew, and in a more especial manner, to her
service; choosing her for our Lady, advocate, and
mother.<a id="FNanchor_1746" href="#Footnote_1746" class="fnanchor">[1746]</a> Then we should ask pardon for our negligence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_653"></a>[653]</span>
in her service during the past year, promising
her greater fidelity for the year that is to come. In
a word, let us pray her to accept us as her servants,
and obtain for us a holy death.</p>

<h5>DEVOTION III.—OF THE ROSARY AND OFFICE.</h5>

<p>The devotion of the most holy Rosary is known to
have been revealed to St. Dominic by the divine
mother herself, when the saint, being in affliction, and
bewailing to his Lady the conduct of the Albigensian
heretics, who at that time were doing great injury to
the Church, the Virgin said to him: “This earth will
always be barren, until the rain falls on it.” St.
Dominick was then given to understand that this rain
was to be the devotion of the Rosary, and that he was
to publish it. And indeed the saint preached it everywhere,
and this devotion was embraced by all Catholics,
so that, at the present day, there is no devotion
more practised by the faithful of every condition, than
that of the most holy Rosary. What have not modern
heretics, as Calvin, Bucer, and others said, to
bring into contempt the use of the Rosary? But the
great good is well known, which this noble devotion
has brought to the world. How many by its means
have been freed from sin! How many led to a holy
life! How many have had a good death and are now
saved! Let us read the various books which treat of
it; it is enough to know that this devotion has been
approved by the holy Church, and the sovereign Pontiffs
have attached indulgences to it. To him who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_654"></a>[654]</span>
recites the third part of the Rosary, the indulgence
of seventy thousand years is granted, and to him who
recites it entire, eighty thousand, and yet more to him
who recites it in the chapel of the Rosary. Benedict
XIII. at length annexed to the Rosary (for him at
least who recites the third part of the Rosary which
has been blessed by the Dominican Fathers) all the
indulgences which are attached to the Rosaries of St.
Bridget, namely, one hundred days for every “Hail
Mary” and “Our Father” that is repeated. And,
moreover, those who recite the Rosary gain the plenary
indulgence on all the principal feasts of Mary
and of the holy Church, and also of the Dominican
Saints, if they visit their churches after confession
and communion. But let it be remarked that this is
understood of those whose names are inscribed in the
book of the Rosary, to whom a plenary indulgence is
also granted on the day when their names are inscribed,
provided they have made their confession and communion,
and one hundred years if they wear the Rosary;
and to those who make mental prayer once a
day, seven years each time, and a plenary indulgence
at the end of the month.</p>

<p>In order to gain the indulgences attached to the
recitation of the Rosary, it is necessary to meditate
the mysteries which are to be found recorded in many
books; but it is sufficient for those who do not know
them to contemplate any one of the mysteries of the
passion of Jesus Christ, as the scourging, death, &amp;c.
The Rosary must be recited with devotion; and here<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_655"></a>[655]</span>
call to mind what the holy Virgin said to St. Eulalia,
namely, that she was better pleased with five decades
said with pauses and devotion, than with fifteen in
haste and with less devotion. On this account it is
well to say the Rosary kneeling, and before some
image of Mary, and at the beginning of every decade
to make an act of love to Jesus and Mary, by asking
some favor. And, moreover, let it be remarked that
it is more efficacious to say the Rosary in company
with others, than to say it alone.</p>

<p>Urban II. attached many indulgences to the recitation
of the little office of our Lady, which is said to
have been composed by St. Peter Damian; and the
holy Virgin has often made known how pleasing to
her was this devotion, as we learn from Father Auriemma.<a id="FNanchor_1747" href="#Footnote_1747" class="fnanchor">[1747]</a>
The Litanies are also very pleasing to her,
and an indulgence of two hundred days is granted
every time they are recited; also the hymn, “Hail,
star of the sea,” “Ave Maris stella,” which the divine
mother ordered St. Bridget to repeat every day; and
more than all, the “Magnificat,” for with this we praise
her in the very words with which she praised God.</p>

<h5>DEVOTION IV.—OF FASTING.</h5>

<p>Many servants of Mary, on Saturdays and the
vigils of her feasts, are accustomed to honor her by
fasting on bread and water. It is well known that
Saturday is a day dedicated by the holy Church to
the honor of the Virgin, because on this day, says St.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_656"></a>[656]</span>
Bernard, she remained constant in the faith after the
death of her Son.<a id="FNanchor_1748" href="#Footnote_1748" class="fnanchor">[1748]</a> For this reason the servants of
Mary never fail on this day to offer her some special
homage; and particularly the fast on bread and water,
as St. Charles Borromeo, Cardinal Toledo, and so
many others practised it. Rittard, Bishop of Bamberg,
and Father Joseph Arriaga, of the Society of
Jesus, did not even taste food on Saturday. The
great graces which the mother of God afterwards
bestowed upon those who practised this devotion, may
be read in the writings of Father Auriemma. It is
sufficient for us to mention the compassion which she
showed to that bandit chief, who, on account of this
devotion, was permitted to remain alive, although his
head had been cut off, and although he was under
the displeasure of God, and was enabled to make his
confession before dying. He afterwards declared that
the holy Virgin, for this fasting which he had offered
her, had preserved him in life, and he then suddenly
expired.<a id="FNanchor_1749" href="#Footnote_1749" class="fnanchor">[1749]</a> It would not then be a very extraordinary
thing, if any one, especially devoted to Mary, and
particularly if he had already deserved hell, should
offer to her this fast on Saturday. He who practises
this devotion, I may say, will hardly be condemned;
not that our Lady will deliver him by a miracle if he
dies in mortal sin, as happened to the bandit; such<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_657"></a>[657]</span>
prodigies of divine mercy seldom take place, and it
would be madness to expect eternal salvation by
them. But I do say that the divine mother will
readily obtain perseverance in divine grace and a good
death for him who will practise this devotion. All
the brothers of our little congregation who can do so,
fast on bread and water on Saturday, in honor of
Mary. I say those who can do so, meaning, that if
any one is prevented from doing so on account of ill
health, at least on Saturday he may content himself
with one dish, make a common fast, or at least abstain
from fruits or other agreeable food. It is necessary
on Saturday to offer special devotions to our Lady, to
receive communion, or, at least, hear mass, visit some
image of the Virgin, wear hair-cloth, and the like.
And at least on the vigils of the seven feasts of
Mary, let her servants endeavor to offer this fasting
on bread, or in any other manner they are able.</p>

<h5>DEVOTION V.—OF VISITING THE IMAGES OF MARY.</h5>

<p>Father Segneri says, that the devil could in no better
way console himself for the losses he has sustained
by the overthrow of idolatry, than by attacking sacred
images through the heretics. But the holy Church
has defended them even by the blood of the martyrs;
and the divine mother has also made manifest
by miracles, how much she is pleased by devotion
and visits to her images. The hand of St. John of
Damascus was cut off because he defended with his
pen the images of Mary; but our Lady restored it to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_658"></a>[658]</span>
him in a miraculous manner. Father Spinelli relates,
that in Constantinople, every Friday after vespers, a
veil which hung before the image of Mary was withdrawn
of itself, and after vespers on Saturday it closed
of itself. The veil before an image of the Virgin was
seen to withdraw itself, in a similar way, by St. John
of God, whereupon the Sacristan, believing the saint
to be a robber, struck him with his foot, but the foot
was withered. All the servants of Mary, therefore,
are accustomed often to visit her images with great
devotion, and also the churches dedicated to her honor.
These are, indeed, as St. John of Damascus teaches,
the cities of refuge, where we find safety from
temptations, and from the punishments merited by
the sins we have committed. St. Henry, Emperor,
when he entered a city, always visited, before
any thing else, some church of our Lady. Father
Thomas Sanchez never returned home until he had
visited some church of Mary. Let us not be weary
then of visiting our queen every day in some church
or chapel, or in our own house, where it would be
well for that purpose to have in some retired place a
little oratory, with her image, adorned with drapery,
flowers, tapers, or lamps, and before it also the litanies,
the rosary, &amp;c., may be said. For this purpose
I have published a little book, which has already gone
through eight editions, of Visits to the most Holy Sacrament,
as well as to the Virgin, for every day in the
month. Some devout servant of Mary might cause
one of her feasts to be celebrated in some church or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_659"></a>[659]</span>
chapel, and preceding it by a Novena, with the exposition
of the Sacrament, and also with sermons.</p>

<p>But here it is well to notice the fact which Father
Spinelli relates in the “Miracles of the Madonna.”<a id="FNanchor_1750" href="#Footnote_1750" class="fnanchor">[1750]</a>
In the year 1611, in the celebrated sanctuary of Mary
in Montevergine, it happened that on the vigil of Pentecost
the people who thronged there profaned that
feast with balls, excesses, and immodest conduct, when
a fire was suddenly discovered bursting forth from the
house of entertainment where they were feasting, so
that in less than an hour and a half it was consumed,
and more than one thousand five hundred persons
were killed.</p>

<p>Five persons who remained alive affirmed upon
oath, that they had seen the mother of God herself,
who with two lighted torches set fire to the inn.
After this I entreat the servants of Mary to abstain
as far as they can, and to induce others to abstain
from going to such sanctuaries of our Lady in times
of feasting, for hell then received much more fruit
from it, than the divine mother received honor. Let
him who practises this devotion go and visit them at
a time when they are not thronged.</p>

<h5>DEVOTION VI.—OF THE SCAPULAR.</h5>

<p>As men take pride in having others wear their livery,
so the most holy Mary is pleased when her servants
wear her scapular, as a mark that they have dedicated
themselves to her service, and are of the number<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_660"></a>[660]</span>
of the family of the mother of God. Modern heretics,
of course, ridicule this devotion, but the holy Church
has approved it by many bulls and indulgences. And
Father Crasset relates,<a id="FNanchor_1751" href="#Footnote_1751" class="fnanchor">[1751]</a> and also Father Lezzana,<a id="FNanchor_1752" href="#Footnote_1752" class="fnanchor">[1752]</a>
when speaking of the scapular of Mt. Carmel, that
about the year 1251, the holy Virgin appeared to the
blessed St. Simon Stock, an Englishman, and giving
him her scapular, said to him that those who wore it
should be safe from eternal damnation, in these words:
“Receive, oh my very beloved son, this scapular of thy
order, the badge of my confraternity, a privilege
granted to thee and to all other Carmelites; and any
one who wears this at death shall be delivered from
eternal flames.”<a id="FNanchor_1753" href="#Footnote_1753" class="fnanchor">[1753]</a> And Father Crasset still further relates,
that Mary appeared at another time to Pope John
XXII., and directed him to declare to those who wore
the above-mentioned scapular, that they should be
released from purgatory on the Saturday after their
death; this the same pontiff announced in his
bull, which was afterwards confirmed by Alexander
V., Clement VII., and others, as the above-named
Father Crasset relates in the passage before cited.
And as we have remarked in the first part,<a id="FNanchor_1754" href="#Footnote_1754" class="fnanchor">[1754]</a> Paul V.
mentions the same, and appears to explain the bulls
of the preceding pontiffs, prescribing in his bull the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_661"></a>[661]</span>
conditions to be observed in order to gain the indulgences
annexed, namely, the observance of chastity
according to the state of life, the recitation of the little
office of the Virgin, and for him who cannot recite
that, the observance, at least, of the fasts of the
Church and abstinence from meat on Wednesday. Thus
the indulgences that are attached to this scapular of
our Lady of Mt. Carmel, as well as to the others of
the dolors of Mary, of Mary of Mercy, and particularly
to that of the Conception, are innumerable, daily,
and plenary, in life and at the article of death. For
myself, I have taken all the above-mentioned scapulars.
And let it be particularly made known that,
besides many particular indulgences, there are annexed
to the scapular of the Immaculate Conception, which
is blessed by the Theatine Fathers, all the indulgences
which are granted to any religious order, pious place,
or person. And particularly by reciting “Our Father,”
“Hail Mary,” and “Glory be to the Father,” six times,
in honor of the most holy Trinity and of the immaculate
Mary, are gained each time all the indulgences of
Rome, Portiuncula, Jerusalem, Galicia, which reach
the number of four hundred and thirty-three plenary
indulgences, besides the temporal, which are innumerable.
All this is transcribed from a sheet printed by
the same Theatine Fathers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_662"></a>[662]</span></p>

<h5>DEVOTION VII.—OF ENTERING INTO THE CONFRATERNITIES OF MARY.</h5>

<p>Some persons disapprove of confraternities, saying
that they give rise to contention, and that many persons
join them for human ends. But as the Church
and the sacraments are not condemned because there
are many who abuse them, neither should we condemn
the confraternities. The sovereign pontiffs, instead of
condemning them, have approved and highly commended
them, and enriched them with indulgences.
St. Francis of Sales earnestly exhorts laymen to enter
into the confraternities. What did not St. Charles
Borromeo do to establish and multiply these sodalities?
And in his synods he distinctly intimates to
confessors that they should endeavor to induce their
penitents to join them.<a id="FNanchor_1755" href="#Footnote_1755" class="fnanchor">[1755]</a> And with reason, for these
confraternities, especially those of our Lady, are like
so many arks of Noe, in which the poor people of the
world may find refuge from the deluge of temptations
and sins which inundate them in it. We well learn in
the course of our missions the utility of these confraternities.
Speaking exactly, there are found more
sins in a man who does not belong to the confraternities
than in twenty who frequent them. The confraternity
may be said to be the tower of David:
“The tower of David, a thousand bucklers hang upon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_663"></a>[663]</span>
it, all the armor of valiant men.”<a id="FNanchor_1756" href="#Footnote_1756" class="fnanchor">[1756]</a> And this is the
cause of the good obtained from the confraternities,
namely, that their members acquire in them many defences
against hell; and they make use in them of
many means to preserve themselves in divine grace,
which it is very difficult for persons in the world, who
are not in confraternities, to practise.</p>

<p>In the first place, one of the means of salvation is
meditating on eternal truths: “Remember thy last
end, and thou shalt never sin.”<a id="FNanchor_1757" href="#Footnote_1757" class="fnanchor">[1757]</a> And so many are
lost because they do not think of it: “With desolation
is all the land made desolate, because there is none that
considereth in the heart.”<a id="FNanchor_1758" href="#Footnote_1758" class="fnanchor">[1758]</a> But those who belong to
the confraternity are led to think by the many meditations,
readings, and sermons that are made there.
My sheep hear my voice: “Oves meæ vocem meam
audiunt.”<a id="FNanchor_1759" href="#Footnote_1759" class="fnanchor">[1759]</a> Secondly, In order to be saved it is
necessary to commend one’s self to God: Ask, and
you shall receive: “Petite, et accipietis.”<a id="FNanchor_1760" href="#Footnote_1760" class="fnanchor">[1760]</a> And the
brothers of the confraternities do this continually; and
God hears them more graciously, because he has himself
said, that he will willingly grant great graces to
prayers made in common: “If two of you shall agree
upon earth concerning any thing, whatsoever they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_664"></a>[664]</span>
shall ask, it shall be done for them by my Father who
is in heaven.”<a id="FNanchor_1761" href="#Footnote_1761" class="fnanchor">[1761]</a> Concerning which St. Ambrose says:
Many who are small, if they unite together become
great; and the prayers of many cannot but be heard.<a id="FNanchor_1762" href="#Footnote_1762" class="fnanchor">[1762]</a>
In the third place, in the confraternity the sacraments
are more frequently approached, on account of the
rules, as well as on account of the example of other
members. And by this means perseverance in divine
grace is more easily obtained; the holy Council of Trent
having declared the communion to be: “An antidote by
which we are freed from daily sins, and are preserved
from mortal sins.”<a id="FNanchor_1763" href="#Footnote_1763" class="fnanchor">[1763]</a> Fourthly, Besides the sacraments
in the sodalities, there are practised many exercises of
mortification, humility, and charity towards infirm and
poor members; and it would be well if in every confraternity
were introduced the holy custom of assisting
the infirm poor of the country. It would be a still
greater advantage if there could be introduced into
them, in honor of the divine mother, the <i>secret sodality</i>
of more fervent members. I will here enumerate the
exercises that are usually practised in these. 1. Half
an hour of reading. 2. Vespers and complin of the
Holy Spirit are said. 3. The litanies of the Virgin
are repeated, and then some brothers who are designated,
practise mortifications by bearing the cross<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_665"></a>[665]</span>
upon their shoulders, or others of a similar kind.
4. For one quarter of an hour a meditation is made
on the passion of Jesus Christ. 5. Each one accuses
himself of any violation against the rules of which he
has been guilty, and receives penance for it from the
father of the congregation. 6. The little flowers of mortification
made during the past week are read by one
of the brothers who is selected, and then the Novenas
to be said are announced, &amp;c. Finally, the discipline
is made for the space of a Miserere and a Salve, and
every one kisses the feet of the crucifix which is at the
foot of the altar. The rules, then, would be for each
brother: 1. To make a meditation every day. 2. A
visit to the most holy Sacrament and to the blessed
Virgin. 3. In the evening an examination of conscience.
4. Spiritual reading. 5. To avoid games
and the conversation of the world. 6. To frequent
the communion and practise some mortification of the
chain, discipline, &amp;c. 7. To recommend every day to
God the souls in purgatory, and sinners. 8. If any
brother is sick, to visit him. But let us return to our
subject. In the fifth place: It has already been said
how much more sure is our salvation if we serve the
mother of God; and do not the brothers serve her in
the congregation? How much do they praise her
there! How many prayers do they offer up to her!
There they consecrate themselves from the beginning
to her service, choosing her, in an especial manner,
for their Lady and mother; and they are inscribed in
the book of the children of Mary; hence as they are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_666"></a>[666]</span>
distinguished servants and children of the Virgin, she
therefore treats them with distinction, and protects
them in life and in death. Thus a brother of the confraternity
may say that, with the confraternity, he has
received every blessing: Now all good things come
to me together with her: “Venerunt mihi omnia bona
pariter cum ilia.”<a id="FNanchor_1764" href="#Footnote_1764" class="fnanchor">[1764]</a></p>

<p>Every brother should pay particular attention to
two things. First, as to the end; that is, to enter the
confraternity for no other end but to serve God and
his holy Mother, and save his own soul. 2d. Not to
leave the congregation on the appointed days, for affairs
of the world, since there the most important business
in the world is to be transacted, namely, eternal
salvation. Endeavor also to draw as many as you can
to the confraternity, and especially to induce those
brothers who have left it to return to it again. Oh,
what terrible punishments has our Lord caused those
to suffer who have abandoned the confraternity of our
Lady! In Naples a certain brother left the congregation,
and being exhorted to return, he said: I will return
when my legs are broken and my head cut off.
And he was a prophet: for very soon after his legs
were broken and his head cut off by some of his enemies.<a id="FNanchor_1765" href="#Footnote_1765" class="fnanchor">[1765]</a>
On the other hand, the members who persevere
are favored by Mary with spiritual and temporal
good: All her domestics are clothed with double
garments: “Omnes domestici ejus vestiti sunt<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_667"></a>[667]</span>
duplicibus.”<a id="FNanchor_1766" href="#Footnote_1766" class="fnanchor">[1766]</a> We may read in Father Auriemma<a id="FNanchor_1767" href="#Footnote_1767" class="fnanchor">[1767]</a> the
special graces granted by Mary to the brothers of the
confraternity in life and in death, but especially in
death. Father Crasset relates<a id="FNanchor_1768" href="#Footnote_1768" class="fnanchor">[1768]</a> that in 1586 there
was a youth who, being near death, fell asleep; but
afterwards awaking, he said to his confessor: “Oh
Father, I have been in great danger of hell, but my
Lady has rescued me. The devils have presented my
sins before the tribunal of the Lord, and already they
were dragging me to hell, but the holy Virgin came
and said to them: ‘Where are you taking this youth?
What have you to do with one of my servants who
has so long served me in the congregation?’ The
devils fled, and thus I have been saved from their
hands.” The same author relates soon after that
another brother of the congregation, also at the point
of death, had a great conflict with hell; but he conquered,
and full of joy, exclaimed: “Oh, what blessings
come from serving the blessed mother well in her
confraternity!” And thus entirely consoled, he died.
He afterwards adds that the Duke of Popoli being on
his death-bed, said to his son: “My son, know that the
little good I have done in life I owe to the congregation;
and therefore I have no greater good to leave
thee than the confraternity of Mary. I am more
proud of having been a brother of the congregation
than the Duke of Popoli”.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_668"></a>[668]</span></p>

<h5>DEVOTION VIII.—OF ALMS IN HONOR OF MARY.</h5>

<p>The servants of Mary are accustomed, especially on
Saturday, to give alms in honor of the divine mother.
That holy shoemaker called St. Deusdedit (God gave),
as St. Gregory relates in his Dialogues, dispensed to
the poor on Saturday all that he earned during the
week. And another holy soul saw in a vision a
sumptuous palace which God was preparing in
heaven for this servant of Mary, in the building of
which nothing was done except on Saturday. St.
Gerard never refused any thing that was asked him in
the name of Mary. Father Martin Guttierez, of the
Society of Jesus, did the same, and he confessed that
he had never asked a favor from Mary that he had
not received it. And this servant of hers having been
slain by the Huguenots, the divine mother appeared
to his companions, accompanied by some virgins, whom
she directed to wrap the body in a sheet and carry it
away.<a id="FNanchor_1769" href="#Footnote_1769" class="fnanchor">[1769]</a> St. Eberard of Salisbury practised the same
devotion, and on this account a holy monk saw him,
in the form of a child, in the arms of Mary, who said:
“This is my Son Eberard, who never has refused me
any thing.”<a id="FNanchor_1770" href="#Footnote_1770" class="fnanchor">[1770]</a> Alexander de Hales practised the same,
who, having been requested by a lay-brother of St.
Francis, in the name of Mary, to become a Franciscan,
left the world and entered into the order.<a id="FNanchor_1771" href="#Footnote_1771" class="fnanchor">[1771]</a> Let not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_669"></a>[669]</span>
the servants of the Virgin then be weary of giving
daily some little alms in her honor, and increase it
every Saturday. And if they can do nothing else, at
least for love of Mary, perform some other act of
charity, as visiting the sick, praying for sinners and
for the souls in purgatory, &amp;c. Works of mercy are
very pleasing to this mother of mercy.</p>

<h5>DEVOTION IX.—OF FREQUENT RECOURSE TO MARY.</h5>

<p>Of all devotions, none is so pleasing to our mother,
as recurring often to her intercession, by asking help
of her in all special necessities, as in taking or giving
counsel, in dangers, afflictions, and temptations, particularly
in temptations against purity. The divine
mother will certainly deliver us if we have recourse
to her with the Antiphon: We fly to thy patronage:
“Sub tuum præsidium,” etc., or with a “Hail Mary,”
or only invoking the most holy name of Mary, which
has particular power against demons. The blessed St.
Francis, in a temptation against purity, had recourse
to Mary, and she immediately appeared to him, and
placing her hand upon his breast, delivered him. It
is useful to kiss or press the rosary, or the scapular,
or even to look on some image of the Virgin. And
be it known that Benedict XIII. granted fifty days’
indulgence to those who pronounce the name of Jesus
and Mary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_670"></a>[670]</span></p>

<h5>TENTH AND LAST DEVOTION.</h5>

<p>I unite in this various practices of devotion in honor
of Mary. 1. To celebrate, or cause to be celebrated,
or at least to hear Mass in honor of the holy Virgin.
It is true that the holy sacrifice of the Mass can be
offered only to God, to whom it is offered principally
in acknowledgment of his supreme dominion; but as
the sacred Council of Trent declares,<a id="FNanchor_1772" href="#Footnote_1772" class="fnanchor">[1772]</a> this does not
prevent it from being offered to God in gratitude for
the graces bestowed on the saints and his most holy
mother, and in commemoration of them, that they may
deign to intercede for us. And therefore it is said in
the Mass: “That it may avail to their honor, but to
our salvation.”<a id="FNanchor_1773" href="#Footnote_1773" class="fnanchor">[1773]</a> This offering of the Mass, as also
the repeating three “Our Fathers,” “Hail Marys,”
and “Glories” to the most holy Trinity, in gratitude
for the graces granted to Mary, she herself revealed to
a soul, were very pleasing to her; for the Virgin not
being able fully to thank the Lord for all the favors
bestowed on her, is pleased when her children help
her to thank God. 2d. To reverence the saints who
are most closely united to Mary, as St. Joseph, St.
Joachim, and St. Ann. The Virgin herself recommended
to a nobleman the devotion to St. Ann her
mother.<a id="FNanchor_1774" href="#Footnote_1774" class="fnanchor">[1774]</a> And we should also honor the saints who
had the most special devotion to the divine mother,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_671"></a>[671]</span>
as St. John the Evangelist, St. John the Baptist, St.
Bernard, St. John of Damascus, the defender of her
images, St. Ildephonsus, the defender of her virginity,
&amp;c. 3d. To read every day some book which treats
of the glories of Mary. To preach, or at least recommend
to all, particularly to one’s relatives, devotion to
the divine mother. The Virgin one day said to St.
Bridget: “Make thy children my children.” To pray
daily for the living and dead who were most devoted
to Mary.</p>

<p>Let us here enumerate many other indulgences
granted by the Pontiffs to those who, in various ways,
honor this queen of heaven: 1st. To those who say:
“Blessed be the holy and immaculate conception of
the blessed Virgin Mary,” an indulgence of one hundred
years is granted; and when after the word “immaculate,”
the word “most pure” is added, according
to Father Crasset, other indulgences are granted,
applicable to the souls in purgatory. 2d. For the
“Salve Regina,” forty days. 3d. Litanies, two hundred
days. 4th. To those who bow the head at the
names of Jesus and of Mary, twenty days. 5th. To
those who repeat five “Our Fathers” and “Hail
Marys” in honor of the passion of Jesus and the dolors
of Mary, ten thousand years. And for the convenience
of devout souls, I will here mention other indulgences,
attached by the Sovereign Pontiffs to other
devotions: 1st. To him who hears Mass, three thousand
eight hundred years. 2d. Benedict XIV. granted
seven years’ indulgence to those who make the Christian<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_672"></a>[672]</span>
acts, with the intention of receiving in life and in
death the holy sacraments; and if they are continued
for a month, plenary indulgence applicable to the souls
in purgatory, or to themselves at the article of death.
3d. To those who recite fifteen “Our Fathers” and
“Hail Marys,” for sinners, remission of the third part
of their sins. 4th. Pope Benedict XIV. has granted
more indulgences to those who make mental prayer
for half an hour every day, and plenary once a month,
after confession and communion. 5th. To those who
recite the prayer: Soul of Christ, “Anima Christi,”
etc., three hundred days. 6. Those who accompany
the viaticum, obtain five years’ indulgence, and
with lights seven years; and those who cannot do this,
if they accompany it reciting an “Our Father” and
“Hail Mary,” one hundred days. 7th. Those who
kneel before the most holy Sacrament, gain two hundred
days. 8th. Those who kiss the cross, one year
and forty days. Those who bow the head at the
“Glory be to the Father,” thirty days. 10th. To
priests who before Mass recite: I wish to celebrate
Mass, &amp;c., “Ego volo celebrare missam,” etc., fifty
days are granted. 11th. To those who kiss the regular
scapular, five years. Other indulgences may be
found in the works of Father Viva.<a id="FNanchor_1775" href="#Footnote_1775" class="fnanchor">[1775]</a> Let every one
endeavor, when seeking the above-named indulgences,
to make an act of contrition, that he may be in a disposition
to gain them.</p>

<p>I omit other devotions, which are to be found in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_673"></a>[673]</span>
other books, as the seven joys, the twelve privileges
of Mary, and the like, and let us terminate this work
with the beautiful words of St. Bernardine:<a id="FNanchor_1776" href="#Footnote_1776" class="fnanchor">[1776]</a> “Oh
woman, blessed among all women, thou art the honor
of the human race, the salvation of our people. Thou
hast a merit that has no limits, and an entire power
over all creatures. Thou art the mother of God, the
mistress of the world, the queen of heaven. Thou art
the dispenser of all graces, the glory of the holy
Church. Thou art the example of the just, the consolation
of the saints, and the source of our salvation.
Thou art the joy of paradise, the gate of heaven, the
glory of God. Behold, we have published thy praises.
We supplicate thee then, oh mother of mercy, to
strengthen our weakness, to pardon our boldness, to
accept our service, to bless our labors, and impress
thy love upon the hearts of all, that after having honored
and loved thy Son on earth, we may praise and
bless him eternally in heaven. Amen.”</p>

<p>And with this, my dear reader and brother, lover of
our mother Mary, I leave you, saying to you, continue
joyfully to honor and love this good Lady; endeavor
also to promote the love of her wherever you can, and
do not doubt, but securely trust that if you persevere
in true devotion to Mary, even until death, your salvation
will be certain. I finish, not because I have
nothing more to say of the glories of this great queen,
but that I may not weary you. The little that I have
written may indeed be enough to charm you with this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_674"></a>[674]</span>
great treasure of devotion to the mother of God, with
which she will correspond with her powerful patronage.
Accept, then, the desire I have had by this my
work, to see you safe and holy, to see you become a
loving and ardently devoted child of this most amiable
queen. And if you know that this book of mine has
aided you somewhat, I pray you of your charity recommend
me to Mary, and ask of her the grace that I
ask for you, namely, that we may both meet in paradise
at her feet, together with all her other dear
children.</p>

<p>And last of all, I turn to thee, oh mother of my
Lord, and my mother Mary. I pray thee to accept
these my poor labors, and the desire I have had to
see thee praised and loved by all. Thou knowest
how much I have desired to complete this my little
work on thy glories, before my life, which is now
drawing to a close, should end. I now say that I
die content, leaving on the earth this book of mine,
which will continue to praise and to preach thee, as I
have endeavored always to do in these years since my
conversion, which through thee I have obtained from
God. Oh immaculate Mary, I recommend to thee
all those who love thee, and especially those who
will read this my book; and most especially those
who will exercise the charity of recommending me to
thee; oh Lady, give them perseverance, make them
all saints, and thus bring us all to praise thee together
in heaven. Oh, my most sweet mother, it is true that
I am a poor sinner, but I glory in loving thee, and I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_675"></a>[675]</span>
hope great things from thee, among others, that I may
die loving thee. I hope in the sufferings of my death,
when the devil will place my sins before me, that first
the passion of Jesus, and next, thy intercession, may
give me comfort to quit this miserable life in the grace
of God, to come to love him and thank thee, oh my
mother, through all eternity. Amen. Thus I hope,
thus may it be.</p>

<p>Oh Lady, say for us to thy Son: “They have no
wine.” How bright and clear is the intoxicating cup
of this wine! The love of God inebriates us even to
contempt of the world; it warms and strengthens,
renders us insensible to temporal things, and inclined
to heavenly things.<a id="FNanchor_1777" href="#Footnote_1777" class="fnanchor">[1777]</a></p>

<p>Thou art a fruitful field, full of virtues, full of
graces. Thou didst come forth as a bright and
ruddy dawn; for original sin being destroyed in the
womb of thy mother, thou wast born bright in the
knowledge of truth, and ruddy with the love of virtue;
no enemy has power against thee, for a thousand
bucklers hang upon thee, all the armor of valiant
men; for there is no virtue which does not shine in
thee, and thou in thyself dost possess all that belongs
to every saint.<a id="FNanchor_1778" href="#Footnote_1778" class="fnanchor">[1778]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_676"></a>[676]</span></p>

<p>Oh our Lady, our mediatrix, our advocate, commend
us to thy Son. Oh blessed one, obtain by the
grace which thou didst merit, that he who, through
thy means has deigned to become a partaker of our
infirmity and misery, thou also interceding, may make
us partakers of his blessedness and glory.<a id="FNanchor_1779" href="#Footnote_1779" class="fnanchor">[1779]</a></p>

<p>Live Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.</p>

APPERTAINING TO THE MOST HOLY MARY.</h4>

</div>

<p>Some persons, boasting of being free from prejudices,
take great credit to themselves for believing no
miracles but those recorded in the holy Scriptures,
esteeming all others as tales and fables for foolish
women. But it will be well to repeat here a just remark
of the learned and pious Father John Crasset,<a id="FNanchor_1780" href="#Footnote_1780" class="fnanchor">[1780]</a>
who says that the bad are as ready to deride miracles
as the good are to believe them; adding, that as it is
a weakness to give credit to all things, so, on the other
hand, to reject miracles which come to us attested by
grave and pious men, either savors of infidelity, which
supposes them impossible to God, or of presumption,
which refuses belief to such a class of authors. We
give credit to a Tacitus and a Suetonius, and can we
deny it without presumption to Christian authors of
learning and probity? There is less risk, says Father
Canisius, in believing and receiving what is related
with some probability by honest persons, and not rejected
by the learned, and which serves for the edification
of our neighbor, than in rejecting it with a disdainful
and presumptuous spirit.<a id="FNanchor_1781" href="#Footnote_1781" class="fnanchor">[1781]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_680"></a>[680]</span></p>

<p>1st Example.—A certain man in Germany had
committed a great sin, and was ashamed to confess it,
yet on the other hand he could not endure the remorse
which he felt, and went to cast himself into the river;
but just as he was on the point of doing so, he stopped,
and bursting into tears, prayed God to pardon him
without confession. One night in his sleep he felt
some one waking him, and heard a voice saying: Go
and make your confession. He went to the church,
but yet did not make his confession. He heard the
same voice a second night; again he went to the
church, but after he had entered it, said that he would
rather die than confess that sin. He was about to
return home, when he thought he would go and recommend
himself to the most holy Mary, before her
image which was in the church. He had hardly
kneeled before it, when he felt himself entirely changed.
He immediately arose, called for a confessor, and weeping
bitterly, through grace received from the Virgin,
made a sincere confession; and he afterwards said that
he felt greater satisfaction than if he had gained all
the gold in the world.<a id="FNanchor_1782" href="#Footnote_1782" class="fnanchor">[1782]</a></p>

<p>2.—A young nobleman was reading one day, while
at sea, an obscene book, in which he took great pleasure.
A religious said to him: “Now come, would
you give something to our Lady?” “Yes,” he answered;
and the other said, “I wish that, for love of
the holy Virgin, you would tear that book in pieces
and cast it into the sea.” “Here it is, Father,” said<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_681"></a>[681]</span>
the young man. “No,” said the religious, “I wish
that you yourself would make this offering to Mary.”
He did so, and when he returned to Genoa, his native
place, the mother of God so inflamed his heart with
the love of God, that he became a religious.<a id="FNanchor_1783" href="#Footnote_1783" class="fnanchor">[1783]</a></p>

<p>3.—A hermit of Mount Olivet had in his cell a holy
image of Mary, and frequently offered up prayers before
it. The devil could not endure such devotion to
the holy Virgin, and tormented him continually with
temptations against purity; and the poor old hermit
finding himself still pursued by them, notwithstanding
all his prayers and mortifications, said one day to the
enemy: “What have I done to you, that you will not
leave me in peace?” And the demon appeared to
him and answered: “You torment me more than I
torment you;” and then he added: “Now come,
and swear secrecy to me, and I will tell you what you
must cease to do, if you wish me not to molest you
any more.” The hermit took the oath, and then the
devil said to him: “I wish you never again to approach
that image that you have in your cell.” The
hermit was greatly perplexed, and went to take counsel
of the Abbot Theodore, who told him that he was
not bound by his oath, and that he must not cease to
recommend himself to Mary before that image, as he
had done before. The hermit obeyed, and the devil
was put to shame and conquered.<a id="FNanchor_1784" href="#Footnote_1784" class="fnanchor">[1784]</a></p>

<p>4.—A woman who had been guilty of a criminal
connection with two young men, one of whom had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_682"></a>[682]</span>
killed the other, came one day in great terror to
Father Onefrio d’Anna, a pious missionary in the
kingdom of Naples, to make her confession. She
told the Father that in the same hour in which that
wretched youth had died, he appeared to her, clothed
in black, loaded with chains, and cast fire on every
side. He had a sword in his hand, and raised it to
cut her throat. In terror she exclaimed: “What
have I done to you, that you wish to kill me?” And
in a rage he answered: “Wretch, do you ask what
you have done to me? You have caused me to lose
God.” Then she invoked the blessed Virgin; and
that spectre, on hearing the most holy name of Mary
pronounced, disappeared and was seen no more.<a id="FNanchor_1785" href="#Footnote_1785" class="fnanchor">[1785]</a></p>

<p>5.—When St. Dominic was preaching at Carcassone,
in France, an Albigensian heretic, who was possessed
by demons, was brought to him, because he had
publicly spoken against the devotion of the most holy
Rosary. The saint then ordered the demons, in the
name of God, to declare whether those things which
he had said concerning the most holy Rosary were
true; and howling with rage they said: “Hear, oh
Christians, all that this our enemy has said of Mary
and of the most holy Rosary is entirely true.” They
added, moreover, that they had no power against
the servants of Mary; and that many who at death
invoked Mary were saved, contrary to their deserts.
And finally they said: “We are constrained to declare,
that no one is lost who perseveres in devotion<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_683"></a>[683]</span>
to Mary, and in the devotion of the most holy Rosary,
for Mary obtains for sinners a true repentance before
death.” St. Dominick made the people immediately
repeat the Rosary; and, oh miracle! at every “Hail
Mary,” many devils went out from that wretched man,
in the shape of burning coals, so that when the Rosary
was finished, he was entirely freed from them, and
many heretics became converted.<a id="FNanchor_1786" href="#Footnote_1786" class="fnanchor">[1786]</a></p>

<p>6.—The daughter of a certain prince had entered
a monastery, where the discipline was so relaxed, that,
although she was a young person of good dispositions,
she advanced but little in virtue. By the advice of a
good confessor, she began to say the Rosary with the
mysteries, and became so changed that she was an
example to all. The other religious, taking offence at
her for withdrawing from them, attacked her on all
sides, to induce her to abandon her newly-begun way
of life. One day while she was repeating the Rosary,
and praying Mary to assist her in that persecution,
she saw a letter fall from above. On the outside were
written these words: “Mary, mother of God, to her
daughter Jane, greeting;” and within: “My dear
child, continue to say my Rosary; withdraw from
intercourse with those who do not help you to live
well; beware of idleness and vanity; take from thy
cell two superfluous things, and I will be your protectress
with God.” The abbot of that monastery
soon after visited it, and attempted to reform it, but
he did not succeed; and one day he saw a great number<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_684"></a>[684]</span>
of demons entering the cells of all the nuns except
that of Jane, for the divine mother, before whose
image he saw her praying, banished them from that.
When he heard from her of the devotion of the
Rosary which she practised, and the letter she had
received, he ordered all the others to repeat it, and it
is related that this monastery became a paradise.<a id="FNanchor_1787" href="#Footnote_1787" class="fnanchor">[1787]</a></p>

<p>7.—There lived in Rome a woman, called Catherine
the beautiful, who led a very sinful life. Hearing St.
Dominick once preach on the devotion of the most holy
Rosary, she had her name inscribed in the book of the
confraternity, and began to recite it, but did not abandon
her sinful life. One evening a youth, apparently
a noble, came to her house, whom she received courteously.
When they were at supper, she saw drops
of blood falling from his hands while he was breaking
a piece of bread, and then she observed that all the
food he took was tinged with blood. She asked him
what that blood meant? And the youth answered,
that a Christian should take no food that was not
tinged with the blood of Jesus Christ, seasoned with
the memory of his passion. Amazed at this, she
asked him who he was. “Soon,” he answered, “I
will show you;” and when they had withdrawn into
another apartment, the appearance of the youth
changed, and he showed himself crowned with thorns,
his flesh torn, and said to her: “Do you wish to know
who I am? Do you not know me? I am thy
Redeemer. Catherine, when will you cease to offend<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_685"></a>[685]</span>
me? See how much I have suffered for you. You
have grieved me enough, change your life.” Catherine
began to weep bitterly, and Jesus, encouraging
her, said: “Now begin to love me as much as you
have offended me; and know that you have received
this grace from me, on account of the Rosary you
have been accustomed to recite in honor of my mother.”
And then he disappeared. Catherine went in the
morning to make her confession to St. Dominick; and
giving to the poor all she possessed, led so holy a life,
that she attained to great perfection. The Virgin often
appeared to her; and Jesus himself revealed to St.
Dominick, that this penitent had become very dear to
him.<a id="FNanchor_1788" href="#Footnote_1788" class="fnanchor">[1788]</a></p>

<p>8.—The blessed Alanus relates of a lady, named
Dominica, who was accustomed to recite the Rosary,
that she gave up this devotion, and afterwards became
so poor, that in desperation she stabbed herself in three
different places. But just as she was breathing her
last, and the devils came to take her to hell, the most
holy Mary appeared to her, and said to her: “My
daughter, you have forgotten me, but I have not been
willing to forget you, on account of that Rosary which
you have for a time recited in my honor. And now,”
she added, “if you will continue to recite it, I will
restore life to you, and also the possessions you have
lost.” Dominica was restored to health, and continuing
the practice of reciting the Rosary, recovered her
possessions, and at her death was again visited by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_686"></a>[686]</span>
Mary, who commended her fidelity, and she died a
holy death.<a id="FNanchor_1789" href="#Footnote_1789" class="fnanchor">[1789]</a></p>

<p>9.—There lived in Saragossa a certain noble, a very
bad man; his name was Peter, and he was a relation
of St. Dominick. One day when the saint was preaching,
he saw Peter enter the church, and he prayed
the Lord that he would make known to the audience
the condition of that miserable sinner. And, behold,
Peter then appeared like a monster from hell, surrounded
and dragged along by many devils. The
congregation fled, even his wife who was in the
church, and the servants who accompanied him. Then
St. Dominick directed him, through one of his companions,
to recommend himself to Mary, and to begin
to recite the Rosary which he sent him. Peter
received the message, humbled himself, sent to thank
the saint, and received himself the grace to see the
demons that surrounded him. He afterwards went
to make his confession to the saint himself, from
whom he received the assurance that he was already
pardoned, and continuing to recite the Rosary, he
attained to so happy a state, that one day the Lord
made him appear in church, in the presence of the
whole congregation, crowned with three crowns of
roses.<a id="FNanchor_1790" href="#Footnote_1790" class="fnanchor">[1790]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_687"></a>[687]</span></p>

<p>10.—In the mountains of Trent lived a notorious
robber, who when he was one day admonished by a
religious to change his course of life, answered, that
for him there was no remedy. “Do not say so,” said
the religious; “do what I tell you; fast on Saturday
in honor of Mary, and on that day do no harm to any
one, and she will obtain for you the grace of not dying
under the displeasure of God.” The obedient robber
followed this advice, and made a vow to continue to
do so. That he might not break it, he from that time
went unarmed on Saturdays. It happened that on a
Saturday he was found by the officers of justice, and
that he might not break his oath, he allowed himself
to be taken without resistance. The judge, when he
saw that he was a gray-haired old man, wished to
pardon him; but, through the grace of compunction
which he had received from Mary, he said that he
wished to die in punishment of his sins. He also
made a public confession of all the sins of his life in
that same judgment-hall, weeping so bitterly that all
present wept with him. He was beheaded, and buried,
with but little ceremony, in a grave dug near by.
But afterwards the mother of God appeared, with
four holy virgins, who took the dead body from that
place, wrapped it in a rich cloth, embroidered with
gold, and bore it themselves to the gate of the city;
there the blessed Virgin said to the guards: “Tell the
bishop from me, to give an honorable burial, in such
a church, to this dead person, for he was my faithful
servant.” And this was done. All the people of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_688"></a>[688]</span>
place thronged to the spot, where they found the
corpse, with the rich pall, and the bier on which it
was placed. And from that time, says Cesarius, all
persons in that region began to fast on Saturdays.<a id="FNanchor_1791" href="#Footnote_1791" class="fnanchor">[1791]</a></p>

<p>11.—A devout servant of Mary, who lived in Portugal,
fasted on bread and water every Saturday of
his life, in honor of Mary, and chose for his advocates
with the blessed Virgin, St. Michael and St. John the
Evangelist. At the hour of his death the queen of
heaven appeared to him, with those saints, who were
praying for him, and the holy Virgin, looking upon
her servant with a joyful countenance, said to those
saints: “I will not depart hence without taking this
soul with me.”</p>

<p>12.—In one of our missions, after the sermon on
Mary which it is our custom to preach, a very old
man came to one of the Fathers of our congregation,
to make his confession. He was full of consolation,
and said: “Our Lady has done me a favor.” “And
what favor has she done you?” asked the confessor.
“For thirty-five years, Father, I have made sacrilegious
confessions, because I was ashamed of one
sin, and yet I have passed through many dangers,
and have been several times at the point of death,
and if I had died then I certainly should have been
lost; and now our Lady has done me the favor to
touch my heart;” and when he said this he wept so
bitterly, that he seemed to be all tenderness. After
the Father had heard his confession, he asked him<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_689"></a>[689]</span>
what devotion he had practised, and he answered that
he had never failed on Saturday to keep a strict fast
in honor of Mary, and therefore the Virgin had taken
pity on him, and he gave the Father permission to publish
the fact in his sermons.</p>

<p>13.—In the country of Normandy a certain robber
was beheaded, and his head was thrown into a trench;
but afterwards it was heard crying: “Mary, give me
confession.” A priest went to him and heard his
confession; and questioning him as to his practices of
devotion, the robber answered that he had no other
except that of fasting one day of the week in honor
of the holy Virgin, and that for this our Lady had
obtained for him the grace to be delivered from hell
by that confession.<a id="FNanchor_1792" href="#Footnote_1792" class="fnanchor">[1792]</a></p>

<p>14.—There were two young noblemen living in the
city of Madrid who encouraged each other in their
sinful life. One of them saw one night, in a dream,
his companion seized by some Moors and carried to
the shore of a stormy sea. They were about to do
the same with him, but he had recourse to Mary, and
made a vow that he would become a religious at once,
and thus he was rescued from these Moors; then he
saw Jesus seated on a throne, and as if in anger, and
the holy Virgin supplicating and obtaining mercy for
him. When his friend came to visit him he related to
him the vision, but he laughed at it; and shortly after
was stabbed with a poniard and died. When the
other youth saw the vision verified he made his confession,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_690"></a>[690]</span>
and was strengthened in his resolution of becoming
a religious. In view of that, he sold all that
he had, but instead of giving the money to the poor, as
he had intended, he expended it in debauchery. He
afterwards fell ill, and had another vision; he thought
he saw hell opened and the divine Judge in the act of
condemning him. Again he had recourse to Mary,
and Mary again delivered him. He was restored to
health, and led a worse life than before. He went to
Lima, in South America, where he fell ill, and in the
hospital of that place was again touched by the grace
of God. He confessed to Father Francis Perlino, a
Jesuit, to whom he promised to change his life, but
went back to his evil courses. At length the same
Father, visiting one day another hospital in a distant
place, saw that wretched man extended on the earth,
and heard him exclaim: “Ah, I am lost; and for my
greater torment this Father has come here to witness
my punishment. I came here from Lima, and am
brought to this end by my vices, and now I am going
to hell.” With these words on his lips he died, before
the Father had time to give him any assistance.<a id="FNanchor_1793" href="#Footnote_1793" class="fnanchor">[1793]</a></p>

<p>15.—There was once in Germany a certain criminal
condemned to death; but he was obstinate and refused
to make his confession, though a Jesuit father
did his utmost to convert him. He entreated him, he
wept, he cast himself at his feet; but seeing that all
was in vain, he finally said: “Let us recite a ‘Hail
Mary.’” No sooner had the criminal recited it than<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_691"></a>[691]</span>
he began to cry bitterly, made his confession with
much compunction, and wished to die clasping the
image of Mary.<a id="FNanchor_1794" href="#Footnote_1794" class="fnanchor">[1794]</a></p>

<p>16.—In a city of Spain there lived a sinful man
who had given himself to the devil, and had never
been to confession. He did nothing good but say a
“Hail Mary” every day. Father Eusebius Nierembergh
relates, that when this man was at the point of
death the most holy Virgin appeared to him in a
dream and looked on him; her kind eyes so changed
him that he immediately sent for a confessor, made his
confession with a voice broken by sobs, made a vow
to become a religious if he should live, and then
died.<a id="FNanchor_1795" href="#Footnote_1795" class="fnanchor">[1795]</a></p>

<p>17.—A devout servant of Mary always inculcated
it upon her daughter that she should often recite the
“Hail Mary,” especially when she was in any danger.
One day when this girl was resting after a ball, she
was attacked by a demon, who in a visible form, bore
her off with him. He had already seized her, but she
began the “Hail Mary,” and the enemy disappeared.<a id="FNanchor_1796" href="#Footnote_1796" class="fnanchor">[1796]</a></p>

<p>18.—A woman of Cologne who had criminal intercourse
with an ecclesiastic, found him one day hanging
in her rooms dead. After this she entered into
a monastery, where the devil assailed her in a bodily
form, so that she knew not what to do in order to be
delivered from him. A companion suggested to her
to say the “Hail Mary;” and when she did so the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_692"></a>[692]</span>
demon said: “Accursed may she be who has taught
thee this,” and appeared no more.<a id="FNanchor_1797" href="#Footnote_1797" class="fnanchor">[1797]</a></p>

<p>19.—A certain baron who led a very sinful life was
accidentally visited in his castle by a religious, who,
enlightened by God, begged him to assemble together
all his servants. They all came except the chamberlain.
He at last was forced to come in, and the Father
said to him: “Now, I command thee in the name of
Jesus Christ to tell who you are.” And he answered:
“I am a devil from hell, who for fourteen years have
served this villain, waiting until some day he should
omit those seven ‘Hail Marys’ which he is in the
habit of reciting, that I might then strangle him and
take him to the flames of hell.” The religious then
commanded the devil to depart. He obeyed, and disappeared.
The baron then threw himself at his feet,
was converted, and led a holy life.<a id="FNanchor_1798" href="#Footnote_1798" class="fnanchor">[1798]</a></p>

<p>20.—The blessed Francis Patrizii, who greatly
loved the devotion of the “Hail Mary,” recited five
hundred every day. Mary made known to him the
hour of his death. He died as a saint; and after forty
years a most beautiful lily sprung from his mouth, which
was then transported into France, and on the leaves
of it was written the “Hail Mary” in letters of gold.<a id="FNanchor_1799" href="#Footnote_1799" class="fnanchor">[1799]</a></p>

<p>21.—Cesarius relates that a Cistercian lay-brother
could say no other prayer but the “Hail Mary,” and
recited it continually with the greatest devotion. After<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_693"></a>[693]</span>
his death there sprung up from the place where he
was buried a tree, on whose leaves were written these
words: Hail Mary, full of grace: “Ave Maria, gratia
plena.”<a id="FNanchor_1800" href="#Footnote_1800" class="fnanchor">[1800]</a></p>

<p>22.—Three devout virgins, by the advice of their
confessor, recited one year, for forty days, the whole
Rosary, as a preparation for the feast of the purification
of Mary. On the vigil the divine mother appeared to
the first of the three sisters with a rich garment, embroidered
with gold, thanked her, and blessed her.
Then she appeared to the second with a simple garment,
and also thanked her. But she said to her:
“Oh Lady, why have you brought my sister a richer
garment?” “Because she has clothed me,” said
Mary, “more richly than you have done.” She afterwards
appeared to the third with a canvas garment,
and she at once asked pardon for her tepidity in honoring
her. The next year all three fervently prepared
for the same feast, saying the Rosary with great devotion,
when behold, on the evening preceding the festival,
Mary appeared to them in glory, and said to
them: “Be prepared, for to-morrow you shall come
to paradise.” And, in fact, the next day they went
to church, related to the confessor what had occurred,
and received communion in the morning. At the
hour of complin they saw again the most holy Virgin,
who came to take them with her, and amid the songs
of angels, one after the other sweetly expired.<a id="FNanchor_1801" href="#Footnote_1801" class="fnanchor">[1801]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_694"></a>[694]</span></p>

<p>23.—Father Crasset relates, that a certain military
officer told him, that after a battle he found a soldier
on the battle-ground who held in his hand a Rosary
and the scapular of Mary, and asked for a confessor.
His forehead had been pierced by a musket-ball,
which had passed through the head and come out
behind, so that the brain was visible and protruded
through each opening, and he could not live without
a miracle. He however raised himself, made his confession
to the chaplain with great compunction, and
after receiving absolution, expired.<a id="FNanchor_1802" href="#Footnote_1802" class="fnanchor">[1802]</a></p>

<p>24.—The same author adds, that this very captain
told him of being present when a trumpeter of his
company received a pistol-shot from some one near,
and when he examined his breast where he said that
he had been hit, he found that the ball had been
stopped by the scapular of the Virgin, which the man
wore, and that it had not even touched the flesh. He
took it and exhibited it to the whole company.<a id="FNanchor_1803" href="#Footnote_1803" class="fnanchor">[1803]</a></p>

<p>25.—A noble youth, named Eschylus, being sent by
the prince his father to Hildesheim, a city of Saxony,
to study, abandoned himself to a dissolute life. He
fell ill, and was near dying, and while in that state he
had a vision. He saw himself shut up in a furnace of
fire, and believed himself to be already in hell; and
then he escaped from it through a hole and took
refuge in a great palace, where he found the most
holy Mary in the hall, and she said to him: “Rash
man, dost thou dare to appear before me? Depart<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_695"></a>[695]</span>
from here, and go to the flames which thou dost merit.”
The young man besought the Virgin to have mercy
on him, and then turned to some persons who were
near, and implored them to recommend him to Mary.
They did so, and the divine mother answered: “You
do not know the sinful life he has led, and that he
has not even thought of saving a ‘Hail Mary’ in my
honor.” But his advocates answered: “Oh Lady,
he will change his life;” and the youth added: “Yes,
I promise really to amend, and I will be thy servant.”
Then the Virgin’s anger was appeased, and she said
to him: “Well, I accept thy promise, be faithful to
me, and meanwhile, with my blessing, be delivered
from hell and death.” When she had said this, the
Virgin disappeared. Eschylus came to himself, and
blessing Mary, related to others the grace he had received.
He led ever after a holy life, always preserving
a great affection towards the blessed Virgin,
and was made Archbishop of the Church of Lude,
in Denmark, where he converted many to the faith.
Towards the close of his life, being old, he resigned
the archbishopric and became a monk of Clairvaux,
where he lived four years, and died a holy death.
Hence he has been numbered by some writers among
the saints of the Cistercian order.<a id="FNanchor_1804" href="#Footnote_1804" class="fnanchor">[1804]</a></p>

<p>26.—A member of the brothers of the confraternity
of Mary was invited one morning by a friend to dine
with him. He promised to go, but went first to the
meeting of the confraternity, and after that he forgot<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_696"></a>[696]</span>
his promise. His friend was so much offended by
this, that one day when he met him he attempted to
kill him; but, by a just judgment of God, he killed
himself. His friend was immediately taken before the
court, found guilty of the murder, and was condemned
to death. He recommended himself to the Virgin,
and, inspired by her, begged to be led into the presence
of the dead body, and then asked him how he
had died. He confessed that he died by his own
hands, and his friend was set at liberty.<a id="FNanchor_1805" href="#Footnote_1805" class="fnanchor">[1805]</a></p>

<p>27.—In the year 1604, at Dola, a member of the
same confraternity was very ill. On a feast-day he
said to himself: “At this hour my brothers are assembled
and occupied in praising Mary, and am I here”?
He rose from his bed and went to the assembly, when
suddenly the fever left him, and he was restored to
health.<a id="FNanchor_1806" href="#Footnote_1806" class="fnanchor">[1806]</a></p>

<p>28.—A fisherman, belonging to the same confraternity
in Naples, had been ill for several days through
the severe discipline he had practised in the meeting
of the confraternity. Being somewhat better, as he was
poor and had a family, he returned to his fishing, saying
to the most holy Virgin: “Oh, my Lady, for thee
I have suffered this evil, do thou help me”; and our
blessed Lady allowed him to take as many fish as he
would have taken in all the time he had lost.<a id="FNanchor_1807" href="#Footnote_1807" class="fnanchor">[1807]</a></p>

<p>29.—Another member was going to be imprisoned
for debt; he recommended himself to Mary, and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_697"></a>[697]</span>
most holy Virgin inspired his creditors to release him
from his debt, and so they did.<a id="FNanchor_1808" href="#Footnote_1808" class="fnanchor">[1808]</a></p>

<p>30.—A young man who had been a member of the
confraternity of the Virgin, left it, and abandoned
himself to a dissolute life. One night the devil appeared
to him in a frightful form. He began to invoke
the blessed Virgin. “In vain,” said his enemy
to him, “do you invoke her whom you have abandoned;
your sins have made thee mine.” The youth
in terror fell on his knees, and began to recite the
formula of the brothers: “Oh most holy Virgin
mother,” &amp;c. Then the mother of God appeared to
him, at whose presence the demon fled, leaving behind
him a great stench, and an opening in the wall. And
Mary then turned to the youth, and said: “Thou didst
not merit my help, but I wish to take pity on thee, that
thou mayest change, and return to the confraternity.”<a id="FNanchor_1809" href="#Footnote_1809" class="fnanchor">[1809]</a></p>

<p>31.—In Braganza there lived another youth who left
the confraternity and abandoned himself to such
vicious courses, that one day in despair, he was going
to throw himself into a river. But first he turned
to our Lady and said: “Oh Mary, I have served
thee in the confraternity, wilt thou help me?” The
most holy Virgin appeared to him and said: “What
art thou doing? Dost thou wish to destroy both soul
and body? Go, make thy confession, and return to
the confraternity.” The youth, encouraged by this,
thanked the Virgin, and amended his life.<a id="FNanchor_1810" href="#Footnote_1810" class="fnanchor">[1810]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_698"></a>[698]</span></p>

<p>32.—There was once a religious in Spain, who in a
fit of passion killed his superior. After committing
this crime he fled into Barbary, where he renounced
his faith and married, leading afterwards so bad a life
that he did nothing good but say a “Hail, oh Queen,”
daily. One day, being alone, he repeated this devotion,
and behold Mary appeared to him, rebuked him,
and encouraged him to amend his life, promising him
her assistance. He then returned to his house, and
was so sorrowful that his wife questioned him as to
the cause, and he in tears told her his condition, and
the vision he had seen. She took compassion on him,
gave him money to enable him to return to his own
country, and also consented that he should take one
of their children with him. He returned to the monastery,
where he shed so many tears of compunction
that he was again received, together with his son.
He persevered in his holy life, and died with the reputation
of a saint.<a id="FNanchor_1811" href="#Footnote_1811" class="fnanchor">[1811]</a></p>

<p>33.—A pupil had been instructed by his master to
salute the most holy Virgin in these words: “Hail,
oh mother of mercy.” When he was at the point
of death Mary appeared to him, and said: “My son,
do you not know me? I am that mother of mercy
whom you have saluted so many times.” Then this
servant of the Virgin extended his arms as if to follow
her, and gently breathed his last.<a id="FNanchor_1812" href="#Footnote_1812" class="fnanchor">[1812]</a></p>

<p>34.—There was once a sinner who was so abandoned,
that he practised no other devotion than that of reciting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_699"></a>[699]</span>
daily: To thy patronage: “Sub tuum præsidium.”
The Virgin one day so greatly enlightened him, that
he abandoned his sins, entered religion, led for fifty
years an exemplary life, and thus died.<a id="FNanchor_1813" href="#Footnote_1813" class="fnanchor">[1813]</a></p>

<p>35.—In the year 1610, there lived in Turin an obstinate
heretic, who even on his death-bed would not be
converted by all that was said to him by the various
priests who were with him for eight successive days.
At length one of them, almost by force, brought him
to have recourse to Mary, with these words: Mother
of Jesus, help me: “Mater Jesu, assiste mihi.” And
the heretic, as if awakened from sleep, exclaimed, “I
will die a Catholic;” and indeed he became reconciled
to the Church, and died in two hours.<a id="FNanchor_1814" href="#Footnote_1814" class="fnanchor">[1814]</a></p>

<p>36.—Another infidel, who was living in India, was
about to die, abandoned by all, but as he had heard
the Christians so much extol the power of Mary, he had
recourse to her, and the blessed Virgin appeared to
him, and said: “Behold I am she whom you invoke;
become a Christian.” He was immediately restored
to health, and baptized, and many were converted by
the prodigy.<a id="FNanchor_1815" href="#Footnote_1815" class="fnanchor">[1815]</a></p>

<p>37.—There lived in Madrid, in the year 1610, a very
devout servant of Mary, who had an especial devotion
to an image of her called “Mary of Antioch.” He
married a woman, who through suspicion and jealousy,
left him no rest. Every Saturday he went barefoot,
and early in the morning, to visit that image; but his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_700"></a>[700]</span>
wife, who suspected him of going elsewhere, once in
particular, attacked him so violently, that blinded by
impatience, he took a rope and hung himself. But
just as his soul was departing, when he could no more
help himself, he invoked the help of Mary; and behold
a most beautiful lady appeared, who approached
him and cut the rope. The people without saw this,
and then he narrated the fact. By this the wife was so
filled with compunction, that ever afterwards they lived
in peace, and devoted to the divine mother.<a id="FNanchor_1816" href="#Footnote_1816" class="fnanchor">[1816]</a></p>

<p>38.—Another person, of Valentia, in 1613, committed
a great crime, which he was ashamed to confess,
and therefore made sacrilegious confessions. But,
being troubled with great remorse of conscience, he
went one day to visit the altar of Our Lady of Halle,
that he might obtain relief. When he arrived at the
door of the church, which stood open, he felt himself
thrust back by an invisible power. Then he determined
to make his confession, and immediately entered.
After making a general confession, he went home entirely
consoled.<a id="FNanchor_1817" href="#Footnote_1817" class="fnanchor">[1817]</a></p>

<p>39.—The blessed Adam, a Cistercian, went one evening
to visit an altar of the most blessed Virgin in a
church; but finding the doors closed, he knelt outside
to make his devotions. He was hardly on his knees
when he saw the door opening of itself, and he entered.
There he beheld the Queen of Heaven, in the
midst of great splendor, and she said to him: “Adam,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_701"></a>[701]</span>
approach; do you know who I am?” Adam answered:
“No, Lady; who art thou?” “I am,” she
said, “the mother of God. Know, that as a reward
for thy devotion to me, I will always take care of thee.”
And then she placed her blessed hand upon his head,
and cured him of the great pain he was suffering there.<a id="FNanchor_1818" href="#Footnote_1818" class="fnanchor">[1818]</a></p>

<p>40.—A servant of Mary went one day to visit a
church of our blessed Lady, without the knowledge
of her husband, and she was prevented by a severe
storm from returning that night to her own house.
She felt a great fear lest her husband should be very
angry with her; but she recommended herself to
Mary, and when she returned home, her husband was
very kind and gracious to her. Upon questioning him,
she found that the evening before, the divine mother
had taken her form, and attended to all the little
affairs of the household like a servant. She then related
the occurrence to her husband, and they both
afterwards practised great devotion to the blessed
Virgin.<a id="FNanchor_1819" href="#Footnote_1819" class="fnanchor">[1819]</a></p>

<p>41.—A certain cavalier, of the city of Doul, in France,
named Ansaldo, received in battle a wound from an
arrow, which entered so deep into the jaw-bone, that
it was not possible to extract the iron. After four
years of suffering, the afflicted man could endure the
pain no longer, and being besides very ill, he thought
he would again try to have the iron extracted. He
recommended himself to the blessed Virgin, and made
a vow to visit every year a sacred image of her which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_702"></a>[702]</span>
was in that place, and make an offering of a certain
sum of money upon her altar, if she granted his request.
He had no sooner made the vow than the
iron, without being touched, fell into his mouth.
The next day, ill as he was, he went to visit the image,
and scarcely had he placed the promised gift
upon the altar, when he felt himself entirely restored
to health.<a id="FNanchor_1820" href="#Footnote_1820" class="fnanchor">[1820]</a></p>

<p>42.—There was once a Spaniard who held sinful intercourse
with a relative. A devout virgin, while she
was at prayer, saw Jesus on his throne, who was on
the point of sending that criminal to hell; but his holy
mother obtained thirty days’ grace for him, because
he once had honored her. By the command of the
divine mother herself, his female companion told the
whole to her confessor, who made it known to the
young man, and he at once made his confession, with
many tears and promises of amendment. But because
he did not remove the temptation from him, he fell
again into sin, went again to confession, again made a
resolution, and again relapsed. As he did not go to
see the Father again, the Father went to his house to
find him, but was very rudely dismissed. The last of
the thirty days had arrived; the Father went to the
house again, but in vain; he desired the servant, however,
to give him notice if there was any accident; and
indeed at night that miserable sinner was attacked with
violent pains. The Father was called, and endeavored
to relieve him, but the unhappy man exclaimed: “My<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_703"></a>[703]</span>
heart has been pierced with a lance, and I am dying.”
Then giving a groan of despair, he expired.<a id="FNanchor_1821" href="#Footnote_1821" class="fnanchor">[1821]</a></p>

<p>43.—There lived once in Milan a man named Masaccio,
so addicted to gambling, that one day he lost at
play the very clothes he wore. In a violent rage at his
loss, he took a knife and struck an image of the blessed
Virgin, and blood burst forth from it into his face. He
was so much moved that he burst into tears, and
offered thanks to the Virgin that she had obtained for
him time for repentance. He afterwards entered a
Cistercian monastery, and led such a holy life that he
even received the gift of prophecy; after being forty
years a religious, he died a holy death.<a id="FNanchor_1822" href="#Footnote_1822" class="fnanchor">[1822]</a></p>

<p>44.—A very sinful man, once kneeling in tears at
the foot of the cross, prayed that he might receive a
sign of pardon. But when he found that his prayer
was not granted, he turned to an image of the sorrowful
Mary, who then appeared to him, and he saw her
present his tears to her Son, saying: My Son, shall
these tears be lost? “Fili, istæ lacrymæ peribunt?”
And then he was given to understand that Christ had
already pardoned him, and from that time he led a
holy life.<a id="FNanchor_1823" href="#Footnote_1823" class="fnanchor">[1823]</a></p>

<p>45.—A man of advanced age, during one of our
missions, after the usual sermon on the powerful intercession
of Mary, which it is our custom always to
preach in the missions, came to make his confession
to one of our Fathers, named D. Cesar Sportelli, who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_704"></a>[704]</span>
lately died in the fame of sanctity, and was found
uncorrupted many months after his death. Kneeling
at the feet of his confessor, he said: “Father,
our Lady has had pity on me.” “This is her
office,” answered the Father. “But you cannot
give me absolution,” said the other, “for I have
never made my confession.” And, in fact, although
he was a Catholic, he had never made his confession.
The Father encouraged him, heard his confession,
and gave him absolution with great consolation.</p>

<p>46.—The blessed Bernard Tolomeo, founder of the
Olivetan Fathers, who, from his childhood, had a great
devotion to Mary, was one day greatly tormented in
his hermitage at Accona, called Mt. Olivet, with the
fear that he should not be saved, and that God had
not yet pardoned him; but the divine mother appeared
to him, and said: “What do you fear, my son?
Take courage; God has already pardoned you, and is
pleased with the life you lead; go on, and I will help
and save you.” The blessed religious continued to
lead a holy life till he died a happy death in the arms
of Mary.<a id="FNanchor_1824" href="#Footnote_1824" class="fnanchor">[1824]</a></p>

<p>47.—There lived in Germany a young girl, called
Agnes, who had been guilty of incest in the first
degree. She fled into a desert, and there gave birth
to a child. The devil, in the form of a religious,
appeared to her, and persuaded her to throw the
child into a pond. But afterwards, when he proposed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_705"></a>[705]</span>
to her to throw herself in also, she said: “Mary, help
me,” and the devil disappeared.<a id="FNanchor_1825" href="#Footnote_1825" class="fnanchor">[1825]</a></p>

<p>48.—A soldier once made a compact with the devil,
that he would sell his wife to him for a certain sum
of money. He was taking her to a wood to fulfil his
promise, when he passed before a church dedicated
to the Virgin. His wife begged him to allow her to
pay her devotion to Mary in that church; but as she
entered it, Mary came forth from it, and taking the
form of the woman, accompanied the husband. When
they reached the wood, the demon said to the man:
“Traitor, why have you brought me, instead of your
wife, my enemy, the mother of God?” “And thou,”
said Mary, “how hast thou dared to think of injuring
my servant? Go, flee to hell.” And then turning
to the man, she said: “Amend your life, and I will
aid you.” She disappeared, and that wretched man
repented, and amended his life.<a id="FNanchor_1826" href="#Footnote_1826" class="fnanchor">[1826]</a></p>

<p>49.—A very sinful woman who lived in Messico,
having fallen ill, repented of her life, and made a vow
to Mary, that if she would restore her to health she
would present her with her hair. She was cured, and
she cut off her hair, making an offering of it to the
statue of the Virgin. But the woman again fell into
sin, again fell ill, and died impenitent. Then Mary
one day afterwards spoke from that statue to Father
Giammaria Salvaterra, and said: Take those locks
from my head, for they belong to a lost and sinful<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_706"></a>[706]</span>
soul, and are not befitting the head of the mother of
purity. The Father obeyed her, and threw them
himself instantly into the flames.<a id="FNanchor_1827" href="#Footnote_1827" class="fnanchor">[1827]</a></p>

<p>50.—A Saracen, named Petran, made captive several
Christians in Spain, who recommended themselves to
the holy Virgin. Mary appeared to the Saracen, and
said to him: “Petran, how dare you to hold my servants
slaves? Release them immediately—obey.”
And the Moor answered: “Who are you whom I am
to obey?” “I am,” said she, “the mother of God;
and because they have had recourse to me, I wish
you to give them their liberty.” Then the heart of
Petran was changed, he set the Christians free, and
presented himself to the Virgin. She first instructed
him, and then she herself baptized him in a fountain,
near which a church was built, and a Benedictine
monastery.<a id="FNanchor_1828" href="#Footnote_1828" class="fnanchor">[1828]</a></p>

<p>51.—A certain canon, while he was repeating some
devotions in honor of the divine mother, fell into the
river Seine and was drowned, and being in mortal sin,
the devils came to take him to hell. But Mary appeared
at the same time, and said to them: “How
have you dared to take possession of one who died
praising me?” Then turning to the sinner, she said:
Repent, and be particularly devout to my Conception.
He was restored to life, became a religious, and never
ceased to thank his deliverer, and everywhere to propagate
the devotion to her immaculate Conception.<a id="FNanchor_1829" href="#Footnote_1829" class="fnanchor">[1829]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_707"></a>[707]</span></p>

<p>52.—Whilst the monks of Clairvaux were reaping in
the fields, and praising the queen of heaven, most
holy Mary was seen caressing them, and two other
saints wiping their sweat.<a id="FNanchor_1830" href="#Footnote_1830" class="fnanchor">[1830]</a></p>

<p>53.—The brother of the King of Hungary recited
every day the office of Mary. Once when he was
very ill, he made a vow of chastity to the Virgin, if
she would restore him to health; and he immediately
recovered. But his brother having died, he was about
to be married, and just as the nuptials were to be
celebrated, he retired apart to recite his accustomed
office. When he came to the words: Thou art fair
and comely, &amp;c.: “Quam pulchra es et decora,” &amp;c.,
he saw Mary, who said to him: “If I am fair as
you say, why do you leave me for another spouse?
Know, that if you leave her, you shall have me for
a spouse, and the kingdom of heaven instead of the
kingdom of Hungary.” After this the prince withdrew
into a desert near Aquileia, where he lived a
holy life.<a id="FNanchor_1831" href="#Footnote_1831" class="fnanchor">[1831]</a></p>

<p>54.—St. John Climacus relates, that there was a
devout religious, named Carcerio, who was accustomed
often to repeat little songs in praise of Mary, and
always saluted her images with a “Hail Mary.” He
was once afflicted with so painful a malady, that in the
paroxysms of his suffering he bit his lips and tongue.
He lost his speech, and was at the point of death.
Whilst the religious were recommending his soul to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_708"></a>[708]</span>
God, the mother of God appeared to him, and said:
“I have come to cure thee, for I do not wish that
mouth should suffer with which thou hast so often
praised me. Arise, thou art healed, continue to praise
me.” Having said this, she sprinkled him with some
drops of her milk, and immediately he was cured, and
never ceased to praise her, until, visited again by his
Lady at his death, he sweetly expired in her arms.<a id="FNanchor_1832" href="#Footnote_1832" class="fnanchor">[1832]</a></p>

<p>55.—When St. Francis Borgia was in Rome, an ecclesiastic
came to speak with him; but the saint being
much occupied, sent Father Acosta to him. The
ecclesiastic said to him: “Father, I am a priest and
a preacher, but I live in sin, and distrust the divine
mercy. After preaching a sermon one day against
the obstinate, who afterwards despair of pardon, a
person came to me to make his confession, who narrated
to me all my sins, and at length told me that he
despaired of the divine mercy. In order to do my
duty, I told him that he must change his life, and
trust in God; then that penitent rose to his feet and
reproached me, saying: ‘And you, who preach thus
to others, why do you not amend, and why do
you distrust? Know,’ said he, ‘that I am an angel
come to your aid; amend and you will be pardoned.’
And when he had said this he disappeared. I abstained
for several days from my sinful practices, but
when temptation came I again returned to my sins.
On another day, as I was celebrating Mass, Jesus
Christ sensibly spoke to me from the host, and said:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_709"></a>[709]</span>
‘Why dost thou thus maltreat me, when I treat thee
so well?’ After this I resolved to amend, but at the
next temptation fell again into sin. A few hours ago,
a youth came to me in my apartment, and drew from
under his mantle a chalice, and from this a consecrated
host, saying: ‘Do you know this Lord whom
I hold in my hand? Do you remember how many
favors he has done you? Now behold the punishment
of your ingratitude,’ and saying this he drew a
sword to kill me. I then cried: ‘For the love of
Mary do not kill me, for I will indeed amend.’ And
then he said: ‘This was the only thing that could
save you: make a good use of this grace, for this is
the last mercy for you.’ When he had said this he
left me, and I came immediately here, praying you to
receive me among you.” Father Acosta consoled
him, and the priest, by the advice also of St. Francis,
entered another order of strict observance, where he
persevered in holiness till his death.<a id="FNanchor_1833" href="#Footnote_1833" class="fnanchor">[1833]</a></p>

<p>56.—In the year 1228, while a priest was celebrating
Mass on a Saturday, in honor of the most holy Mary,
some Albigensian heretics came and cruelly cut out
his tongue. In this condition he went to the monastery
of Cluny, where the good religious received
him with much charity, greatly compassionating the
suffering he endured from the loss of his tongue. But
what caused the greatest suffering to this devout
priest was, that he could no longer say Mass and recite
the divine office, and that of the blessed Virgin,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_710"></a>[710]</span>
as he had been accustomed to do. The feast of
Epiphany having arrived, he begged to be carried into
the church, and before the altar of the holy Virgin
prayed her to restore the tongue which he had lost
through love of her, that he might sing her praises as
he did before. Then Mary appeared to him with a
tongue in her hand, and said to him: “Since thou
hast lost thy tongue for the faith, and for the honor
thou hast paid me, I give thee in return a new one.”
Having said this, with her own hands she placed the
tongue in his mouth, and immediately the priest,
raising his voice, recited the “Hail Mary.” The religious
quickly assembled, and the priest wished to
remain with them, and to become himself a religious,
that there he might always praise his benefactress.
The mark of the scar was always seen on his tongue.<a id="FNanchor_1834" href="#Footnote_1834" class="fnanchor">[1834]</a></p>

<p>57.—It was in 589 that the famous plague prevailed
in Rome, when men were attacked with sneezing, and
fell down dead. St. Gregory the Great, when he
was carrying in procession through the city an image
belonging to the church of St. Mary Major, in the
place now called the Castle of St. Angelo, saw an
angel in the air, who was replacing in its scabbard a
sword dripping with blood. Then he heard the angels
singing: Oh, Queen of heaven! rejoice, Alleluia; for
he whom thou didst deserve to bear, Alleluia, is risen
again, as he said, Alleluia: “Regina cœli, lætare, Alleluia;
quia quem meruisti portare Alleluia; resurrexit,
sicut dixit, Alleluia.” And St. Gregory responded:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_711"></a>[711]</span>
“Ora pro nobis Deum, Alleluia.” Immediately the
plague ceased, and they then began to celebrate the
greater Litanies every year on the 25th of April.<a id="FNanchor_1835" href="#Footnote_1835" class="fnanchor">[1835]</a></p>

<p>58.—A city of France, called Avignon, was once
besieged by enemies. The citizens prayed to Mary to
defend them, and placed an image of her, which they
had taken from a church, at the gate of the city.
One of the citizens having concealed himself behind
the image, a soldier shot an arrow at him, saying:
“This image shall not save you from death.” But
the image presented her knee, and the arrow remained
fixed in it, and may be seen there even to this day;
and thus she saved the life of her servant. And the
enemy, moved by this prodigy, raised the siege.<a id="FNanchor_1836" href="#Footnote_1836" class="fnanchor">[1836]</a></p>

<p>59.—There was in Naples a Moor, a slave of Don
Octavius del Monaco, who, although he had often
been exhorted to leave his Mahometan sect, remained
obstinate, but yet never failed every evening to keep
lighted, at his own expense, a lamp before an image
of Mary which was in the house. And he said: “I
hope that this Lady will grant me some great favor.”
One night the blessed Virgin appeared to him and
told him he must become a Christian. Still the Turk
resisted, but she placed her hand upon his shoulder,
and said to him: “Now no longer resist, Abel; be
baptized and called Joseph.” In the morning he immediately
went to be instructed, and was baptized
August 10th, 1648, with eleven other Turks. Let it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_712"></a>[712]</span>
be observed that when the divine mother appeared to
him, after she had converted him, she was about to
depart, but the Moor seized her mantle, saying: “Oh
Lady, when I find myself afflicted, I pray thee to let
me see thee.” In fact she one day promised him this,
and when he was in affliction he invoked her, and
Mary appeared again to him, saying: “Have patience,”
and he was consoled.<a id="FNanchor_1837" href="#Footnote_1837" class="fnanchor">[1837]</a></p>

<p>60.—A certain parish priest of Asella, named Baldwin,
became a Dominican, and when he was in his
novitiate there came to him the temptation that he
could do greater good in the world in his parish, and
he resolved to return. But going to take his leave of
the altar of the Rosary, Mary appeared to him with
two vessels of wine; she gave him to drink of the
first, but the novice had hardly tasted it, when he
turned away his mouth, for although the wine was
good, yet it was full of dregs; the second he pronounced
good, and free from dregs: “Now,” said the
most holy Virgin, “there is the same difference between
the life in the world, and the life in religion, which is
under obedience.” Baldwin persevered, and died a
good religious.<a id="FNanchor_1838" href="#Footnote_1838" class="fnanchor">[1838]</a></p>

<p>61.—Another novice, also overcome by temptation,
was about to leave his monastery, but stopping to say
a “Hail Mary” before an image of the Virgin, he felt
himself nailed, as it were, to the floor, from which he
could not rise. He repented, and made a vow of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_713"></a>[713]</span>
persevering. He then recovered his liberty, asked
pardon of the master of novices, and persevered.<a id="FNanchor_1839" href="#Footnote_1839" class="fnanchor">[1839]</a></p>

<p>62.—The blessed Clement, a Franciscan, one morning
delayed going to the common table, that he might
stop and recite certain accustomed devotions to the
most holy Virgin; but she spoke from her image, and
directed him to go with the others, because obedience
pleased her more than all other devotions.<a id="FNanchor_1840" href="#Footnote_1840" class="fnanchor">[1840]</a></p>

<p>63.—Whilst Angela, a daughter of the King of Bohemia,
was in a monastery, Mary appeared to her,
and an angel said to her: “Arise, Angela, and fly to
Jerusalem, for thy father wishes to give thee in marriage
to the prince of Hungary.” The devout virgin
immediately set out on her journey, and again the
divine mother appeared to her and encouraged her to
continue her journey. She was received in Jerusalem
among the Carmelites, and afterwards was commanded
by the blessed Virgin herself to return to her own
country, where she lived a holy life till her death.<a id="FNanchor_1841" href="#Footnote_1841" class="fnanchor">[1841]</a></p>

<p>64.—St. Gregory relates that there was a young
woman named Musa, who had great devotion to the
mother of God; but being, through the evil example
of her companions, in danger of losing her innocence,
one day Mary appeared to her with many saints, and
said to her: “Musa, do you too wish to be one of
these?” Musa answered, “Yes;” and Mary added:
“Withdraw from your companions, and prepare, for
in one month from this you shall come with me.”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_714"></a>[714]</span>
Musa retired from her companions, and related the
vision. On the thirtieth day she was at the point of
death, and the most holy Virgin again appeared to
her and called her. She answered: “Behold, Lady,
I come,” and sweetly expired.<a id="FNanchor_1842" href="#Footnote_1842" class="fnanchor">[1842]</a></p>

<p>65.—Anna Caterina Gonzaga was married to Ferdinand
I., Archduke of Austria, but her husband
dying, she entered the religious order of the Servites,
and had a crown made, on the globes of which were
carved the dolors of the Virgin. She said that for
this crown she renounced all the other crowns of
earth; and, in fact, refused marriage with the Emperor
Rodolph II. When she heard that her younger sister
had been crowned empress, she said: “Let my sister
enjoy her imperial crown; for these garments with
which Mary my queen has clothed me, are to me a
thousand-fold dearer.” The most holy Virgin appeared
to her many times during her life, and at last this good
religious died a holy death.<a id="FNanchor_1843" href="#Footnote_1843" class="fnanchor">[1843]</a></p>

<p>66.—A young clerical student playing one day at
ball with other young men, and fearing he should lose
a ring in his play which had been given him by a
lady, he placed it on the finger of an image of Mary
which was near; and he immediately felt impelled to
make a promise to the Virgin to quit the world and
choose her for his spouse. He made the promise, and
Mary pressed his finger in token that she accepted it.
But after some time he wished to marry another, and
Mary appeared to him and reproached him for his infidelity;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_715"></a>[715]</span>
wherefore he fled into a desert, and led to
the last a holy life.<a id="FNanchor_1844" href="#Footnote_1844" class="fnanchor">[1844]</a></p>

<p>67.—About the year 850, Berengarius, Bishop of
Verdun, in Lorraine, having entered a church where
a certain priest named Bernerio was saying the office
of Mary prostrate before the choir, stumbled against
him, and in his vexation struck him with his foot. In
the night the most holy Virgin appeared to him, and
said: “How is it that you struck with your foot my
servant who was engaged in praising me? Because I
love you,” she added, “you must pay the penalty.”
Then his leg became withered, but he lived and died
a saint; and after many years his body, except that
leg, remained uncorrupted.<a id="FNanchor_1845" href="#Footnote_1845" class="fnanchor">[1845]</a></p>

<p>68.—A young man who was left wealthy at the
death of his parents, by play and dissipation with his
friends, lost all that he had, but always preserved his
chastity. An uncle, who found him reduced to such
poverty by his vices, exhorted him to say every day
a part of the Rosary, promising him that if he would
persevere in this devotion he would procure for him a
good marriage. The youth persevered, and having
amended his life, he was married. On the evening of
his nuptials he rose from the table to go and recite
his Rosary, and when he had finished it, Mary appeared
to him and said: “Now I will reward thee for the
honor thou hast paid me: I do not wish that thou
shouldst lose thy chastity; in three days thou shalt<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_716"></a>[716]</span>
die, and shalt come to me in paradise.” And this
really happened, for immediately a fever attacked him.
He related the vision, and on the third day died in
perfect peace.<a id="FNanchor_1846" href="#Footnote_1846" class="fnanchor">[1846]</a></p>

<p>69.—The devout author of the book in honor of the
most holy Rosary, entitled, “The Secret of every
Grace,” relates that St. Vincent Ferrer once said to a
man dying in despair: “Why will you ruin yourself
when Jesus Christ wishes to save you?” And he
answered, that in spite of Christ he would be damned.
The saint replied: “And you, in spite of yourself,
shall be saved.” He began to recite the Rosary with
the persons of the house, and behold, the sick man
asked to make his confession, made it weeping, and
then died.</p>

<p>70.—The same author also relates that a poor woman,
who was buried by an earthquake under the ruins of
a house, was found alive and uninjured, with her children
in her arms, by some persons who were employed
by a priest to remove the stones. When she was
asked what devotion she had practised, she said she
had never failed to say the Rosary and visit a chapel
of the most holy Mary.</p>

<p>71.—He also relates that another woman who led a
wicked life because she thought it the only means
by which she could gain a livelihood, was counselled to
recommend herself to Mary by saying the Rosary; she
did so, and behold one night the divine mother appeared
and said to her: “Quit your sinful life: as for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_717"></a>[717]</span>
your support, trust in me, and I will think of that.”
The next morning she went to confession, and Mary
most holy provided for her wants.</p>

<p>72.—A person of impure life who had not the courage
to quit his sins, began to say the Rosary, and was
delivered from his vices.</p>

<p>73.—Another person who maintained a sinful friendship
was seized with abhorrence of his sin by saying
the Rosary. He yielded again to temptation, but by
means of the Rosary finally freed himself from it.</p>

<p>74.—A good priest who was attending a woman on
her death-bed, who bitterly hated her husband, not
knowing by what means to convert her, withdrew to
say the Rosary, and at the last moment that woman
saw her sinfulness, repented, and forgave her husband.</p>

<p>75.—Finally, the same author relates, that once making
a mission to the convicts in the galleys of Naples,
he found some who obstinately refused to make their
confession. He suggested to them that at least they
should have themselves enrolled in the confraternity
of the Rosary, and begin to recite it. They consented
to do so, and they had no sooner recited one than they
desired to make their confession, and did so, the first
time for many years. These modern examples serve
to revive our confidence in Mary, seeing that she is at
the present time the same that she always has been
towards those who have recourse to her.</p>

<p>76.—St. Gregory relates that a holy prelate, Bishop
of Ferento, was from childhood devoted to relieving the
poor. It happened one day that a certain priest, his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_718"></a>[718]</span>
nephew, sold a horse for ten crowns of gold, and took
the money and locked it up. The bishop not having
any thing to give when some poor persons came to
beg of him, broke open the chest and distributed the
money to them. His nephew made such a disturbance
when he discovered it, that the holy prelate, not knowing
what to do, went for help to a church dedicated
to Mary. When behold, he saw ten crowns lying
on the drapery of the statue; he took them and gave
them to his nephew.<a id="FNanchor_1847" href="#Footnote_1847" class="fnanchor">[1847]</a></p>

<p>77.—A Lutheran lady of Augsburg in Germany,
who was a very obstinate heretic, happening to pass
one day a small Catholic chapel, went in through curiosity.
She saw there an image of Mary with the infant
Jesus in her arms, and felt moved to make an
offering to it. She accordingly went home, took a
silk cloth, and brought it to the altar of the Virgin.
When she had returned home the most holy Virgin
enlightened her to see the errors of her sect, and she
went immediately to seek some Catholics, abjured heresy,
and was converted to God.<a id="FNanchor_1848" href="#Footnote_1848" class="fnanchor">[1848]</a></p>

<p>78.—In the city of Cesena there lived two very bad
men who were friends. One of them, named Bartholomew,
in the midst of all his vices practised the
devotion of reciting every day the “Stabat Mater” in
honor of the sorrowful Mary. Once when he was
repeating this hymn, Bartholomew had a vision, in
which he seemed to stand with his sinful companion<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_719"></a>[719]</span>
in a lake of fire, and saw the most holy Virgin, moved
to pity, offer her hand and take him from the flames.
She directed him to seek pardon from Jesus Christ, who
showed himself willing to pardon him through the
prayers of his mother. The vision ended, and Bartholomew
at the same moment heard the intelligence
that his friend had been mortally wounded and was
dead. Then he knew the truth of the vision, and quitting
the world, entered the order of Capuchins, where
he led a most austere life, and died in the fame of
sanctity.<a id="FNanchor_1849" href="#Footnote_1849" class="fnanchor">[1849]</a></p>

<p>79.—The blessed Jerome, founder of the Sommaschian
Fathers, being governor of a certain place, was
taken by the enemy, and confined in the dungeon of a
tower. He recommended himself to Mary, and made
a vow to make a pilgrimage to Treviso in her honor,
if she would rescue him. Then the most holy Virgin
appeared to him surrounded by a great light, and with
her own hands loosed his chains, and gave him the
keys of the prison. He fled from the prison, and,
setting out for Treviso to fulfil his vow, he found himself
immediately surrounded by the enemy. Again
he had recourse to his deliverer, and she again appeared
to him, took him by the hand, and led him
safely through the midst of his enemies, accompanying
him even to the gates of Treviso, where she disappeared.
He made the visit, deposited his chains at
the foot of the altar of Mary, and then devoted himself
to a holy life, by which he has merited recently<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_720"></a>[720]</span>
to be ranked by the holy Church among the number
of the blessed.<a id="FNanchor_1850" href="#Footnote_1850" class="fnanchor">[1850]</a></p>

<p>80.—A priest who had a special devotion to the sorrows
of Mary, often remained alone in a chapel to commiserate
the dolors of his Lady, and, moved by compassion,
was accustomed with a little cloth to wipe, as it
were, the tears of a statue of the sorrowful Virgin which
was in that place. Now this good priest, in a severe illness,
when he was given up by his physicians, and was
going to breathe his last, saw a beautiful lady by his side,
who consoled him with her words, and with a handkerchief
gently wiped the sweat from his brow, and
with this cured him. When he found himself well,
he said: “But, my Lady, who art thou who dost practise
such charity towards me?” “I am she,” answered
Mary, “whose tears thou hast so often dried,”
and she disappeared.<a id="FNanchor_1851" href="#Footnote_1851" class="fnanchor">[1851]</a></p>

<p>81.—A noble lady, who had an only son, was informed
one day that he was killed, and that his murderer
had by chance taken refuge in her own palace;
but when she called to mind that Mary pardoned the
executioners of her Son, she wished also to pardon that
criminal for love of the sorrowful Mary; and not only
did she pardon him, but provided him with a horse,
money, and clothes, that he might make his escape.
Then her son appeared to her, and told her that he
was saved, and that for her generous act done towards
his enemy, the divine mother had delivered him from
purgatory, where he should otherwise have had to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_721"></a>[721]</span>
suffer for a long time, but that he was then already
entering paradise.<a id="FNanchor_1852" href="#Footnote_1852" class="fnanchor">[1852]</a></p>

<p>82.—The blessed Bionda performed a similar heroic
act. Some enemies also killed her only son, though he
was innocent, solely by reason of the hatred they bore
to his father, who was dead; and with unheard-of cruelty
gave the heart of the murdered youth to his
mother to eat. Now she, according to the example
of the most holy Mary, began to pray for her murderers,
and to do them all the good she could. These
acts so pleased the divine mother, that she called her
to join the third order of the Servites, where she merited
to lead so holy a life, that both before and after
her death many miracles were wrought through her.<a id="FNanchor_1853" href="#Footnote_1853" class="fnanchor">[1853]</a></p>

<p>83.—St. Thomas of Canterbury, when he was a
young man, found himself one day in conversation with
several other youths, each of whom boasted of some
foolish love affair. The holy youth declared that he,
too, loved a great lady, and was beloved by her,
meaning the most holy Virgin. Afterwards, he felt
some remorse at having made this boast; but behold,
Mary appeared to him in his trouble, and with a gracious
sweetness said to him: “Thomas, what do you
fear? You had reason to say that you loved me, and
that you are beloved by me. Assure your companions
of this, and as a pledge of the love I bear you, show
them this gift that I make you.” The gift was a small
box, containing a chasuble, of a blood-red color, as a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_722"></a>[722]</span>
sign that Mary, for the love she bore him, had obtained
for him the grace to be a priest and a martyr, which
indeed happened, for he was first made priest and afterwards
Bishop of Canterbury, in England, where he
was at one time persecuted by the king, and fled to
the Cistercian monastery, at Pontignac, in France.
While he was there, wishing one day to mend his hair-cloth
shirt that he usually wore, which was ripped,
and not being able to do it well, his beloved queen
appeared to him, and, with especial kindness, took the
hair-cloth from his hand, and repaired it as it should
be done. After this he returned to Canterbury, and
died a martyr, having been put to death on account of
his zeal for the Church.<a id="FNanchor_1854" href="#Footnote_1854" class="fnanchor">[1854]</a></p>

<p>84.—A young woman in the Papal States, who was
very devout towards Mary, met in a certain place a
chief of banditti. Fearing some outrage, she implored
him, for love of the most holy Virgin, not to molest
her. “Do not fear,” he answered, “for you have
prayed me in the name of the mother of God; and I
only ask you to recommend me to her.” And, in fact,
he accompanied her himself along the road to a place
of safety. The following night Mary appeared in a
dream to the bandit, and thanking him for the act he
had performed for love of her, told him she would remember
it, and would one day reward him. The robber,
at length, was arrested, and condemned to death;
but behold, the night previous to his execution, the
blessed Virgin visited him again in a dream, and first<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_723"></a>[723]</span>
asked him: “Do you know who I am?” He answered,
“It seems to me I have seen you before.”
“I am the Virgin Mary,” she continued, “who have
come to reward you for what you have done for me.
You will die to-morrow, but you will die with so much
contrition that you will come at once to paradise.”
The convict awoke, and felt such contrition for his
sins that he began to weep bitterly, all the while giving
thanks aloud to our blessed Lady. He sent immediately
for a confessor, to whom he made his confession with
many tears, relating the vision he had seen, and begged
him to make public this grace that had been bestowed
on him by Mary. He went joyfully to execution,
after which, as it is related, his countenance was so
peaceful and happy that all who saw him believed that
the promise of the divine mother was fulfilled.<a id="FNanchor_1855" href="#Footnote_1855" class="fnanchor">[1855]</a></p>

<p>85.—The blessed Joachim Piccolomini, who had a
very great devotion to Mary, even from childhood,
used to visit three times a day an image of the sorrowful
mother, which was in a neighboring church,
and abstained from all food on Saturday in her honor.
Moreover, he rose at midnight to meditate upon her
dolors. But let us see how Mary rewarded him. At
first she appeared to him when he was young, and
directed him to enter into religion in the order of her
Servants, which he did. Towards the close of his
life, she again appeared to him, with two crowns
in her hand: one of rubies, as the reward of the compassion
he had cherished for her sorrows; and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_724"></a>[724]</span>
other of pearls, as the reward of his chastity which
he had consecrated to her. Finally, at death she appeared
to him again, when he asked of her the favor
to die on the day on which Jesus Christ died, and the
most holy Virgin consoled him by telling him: “Make
ready now, for to-morrow (Friday) you will die suddenly,
as you desire, and to-morrow you shall be with
me in paradise.” And thus it happened, for while
they were chanting in the church the passion according
to St. John, at the words: There stood near
the cross of Jesus his mother: “Stabat juxta crucem
Jesu mater ejus,” he was attacked with the faintness
of death; and at the words: And bowing his
head he gave up the ghost: “Et inclinato capite tradidit
spiritum,” this blessed one also gave up his spirit to
God; and at the same moment the church was filled
with a great splendor, and a most sweet fragrance.<a id="FNanchor_1856" href="#Footnote_1856" class="fnanchor">[1856]</a></p>

<p>86.—Father Alphonso Salmerone, of the Society of
Jesus, being a most devout servant of the blessed
Virgin, died saying: “To paradise, to paradise; blessed
be the hour that I have served Mary! Blessed the
sermons, the toils, the thoughts that I have had for
thee, oh my Lady! To paradise.”<a id="FNanchor_1857" href="#Footnote_1857" class="fnanchor">[1857]</a></p>

<p>87.—A youth named Guido, who wished to join the
order of Camaldoli, was presented to St. Romuald by
the prince, his father, whose name was Farnulf. The
holy founder received him with pleasure. One day
Mary appeared to this good youth, her servant, with
the infant Jesus in her arms. Esteeming himself unworthy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_725"></a>[725]</span>
of such a favor, he stood trembling, but the
divine mother drawing near to him, said: “Why do
you doubt? What do you fear, Guido? I am the
mother of God; this is my son Jesus, who wishes to
come to you;” and saying this, she placed him in her
arms. Guido had not yet been three years in religion
when he fell dangerously ill. St. Romuald saw the
poor youth writhing and trembling, and heard him
saying: “Oh Father, do you see all the Moors in this
cell?” “My son,” said the saint to him, “do you
remember any thing you have not confessed?” “Yes,
Father,” he answered, “I remember having disobeyed
the prior, by not picking up certain brooms, and now
I confess it.” St. Romuald absolved him, and then
the scene changed; the devils fled, and the Virgin
again appeared, with Jesus, at the sight of whom
Guido died in perfect peace.<a id="FNanchor_1858" href="#Footnote_1858" class="fnanchor">[1858]</a></p>

<p>88.—A Cistercian nun in Toledo, called Mary, being
at the point of death, the divine mother appeared to
her, and Mary said to her: “Oh Lady, the favor you
do me of visiting me, emboldens me to ask you another
favor, namely, that I may die at the same hour
that you died and entered into heaven.” “Yes,”
answered Mary. “I will satisfy you; you shall die
at that hour, and you shall hear the songs and praises
with which the blessed accompanied my entrance into
heaven; and now prepare.” When she had said this
she disappeared. The religious who heard the nun
talking to herself, believed her wandering in mind, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_726"></a>[726]</span>
she related to them the vision and the promised grace,
and awaited the desired hour; and when she knew it
had arrived, by the striking of the clock (the writer
does not tell us what hour it was), she said: “Behold,
the predicted hour has come; I hear the music of the
angels; at this hour my queen ascended to heaven;
rest in peace, for I am going now to see her;” and saying
this she expired, while her eyes became bright as
two stars, and her face glowed with a beautiful color.<a id="FNanchor_1859" href="#Footnote_1859" class="fnanchor">[1859]</a></p>

<p>89.—In the city of Sens, in France, there lived,
towards the eighth century, St. Opportuna, the daughter
of a prince of royal blood. This holy virgin, who
had a great devotion to Mary, became a religious in a
neighboring monastery, and being at the point of
death, she saw St. Cecilia and St. Lucia standing beside
her in the dawn of the morning. “My sisters,
be welcome,” she said to them; “what message do
you bring me from my queen?” And they answered:
“She is waiting for thee in paradise.” After this the
devil appeared to her, and the saint boldly sent him
away, saying: “Brute beast, what hast thou to do
with me who am the servant of Jesus?” The hour of
her death, which she herself had predicted, having
arrived, after receiving the holy viaticum, she turned
towards the door, and said: “Behold the mother of
God who comes to take me. Sisters, I commend you
to her. Adieu, we shall see each other no more.”
Thus saying, she raised her arms, as if to embrace
her Lady, and gently expired.<a id="FNanchor_1860" href="#Footnote_1860" class="fnanchor">[1860]</a></p>

<h4 class="nobreak" id="NOVENA_OF_MEDITATIONS">NOVENA OF MEDITATIONS<br>
<span class="smaller">FOR THE NINE DAYS PRECEDING THE FEAST OF THE PURIFICATION
OF MARY, WHICH COMMENCES ON THE 24TH OF JANUARY.</span></h4>

</div>

<p>The above-mentioned meditations are upon the Litany of Loretto, and
can be used for all the Novenas preceding the principal festivals of the
Divine Mother.</p>

<h5>FIRST DAY.</h5>

<p>1st. “Sancta Maria, ora pro nobis:” Holy Mary,
pray for us. Since in the Litanies of our Lady the
Church instructs us to repeat so many times the petition
that she will pray for us, “Ora pro nobis,” it is
well before meditating upon the titles by which
the holy Virgin is invoked, to consider of how great
value with God are the prayers of Mary. Blessed is
that person for whom Mary prays! Jesus is pleased
when his most beloved mother prays to him, and
grants all she asks. One day St. Bridget heard Jesus
speaking with Mary, and thus saying to her: “My
mother, ask what thou wilt of me, for thy petition
cannot be in vain.”<a id="FNanchor_1861" href="#Footnote_1861" class="fnanchor">[1861]</a> And then he added: “Thou
didst deny me nothing on earth, I will deny thee<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_728"></a>[728]</span>
nothing in heaven.” St. Bernard says: To be heard
by the Son is to be graciously heard: “A Filio audiri
est exaudiri.” It is enough that Mary speaks, her
Son grants whatever she asks. Therefore let us always
pray to this divine mother if we wish to obtain
eternal salvation, and let us say with St. Andrew of
Candia, or perhaps of Jerusalem: We, then, supplicate
thee, oh most holy Virgin, to grant us the aid of
thy prayers with God; prayers that are more precious
than all the treasures of the earth; prayers that obtain
for us a great abundance of graces; prayers that confound
our enemies, and triumph over their forces.</p>

<p>2d. “Sancta Maria:” Holy Mary. The name of
Mary is a name of salvation. This name came not
from earth, but from heaven; and therefore St.
Epiphanius says, that it was not given to Mary by her
parents, but was bestowed upon her by the express
will of God. Hence it is that after the name of Jesus,
the name of Mary is superior to every name, for God
has filled it with grace and sweetness in order that
through it every blessing may be obtained by him who
names it. St. Bernard said: Oh Mary, thy name
cannot be pronounced without inflaming the heart of
him who utters it with love to thee. And the blessed
Henry Suso exclaimed: Oh Mary, what must thou
thyself be if thy name is so amiable and gracious!
Name full of blessings. St. Bonaventure said that
the name of Mary cannot be invoked without profit to
him who invokes it. But more than all, this name has
the power to overcome the temptations of hell. Ah,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_729"></a>[729]</span>
my Lady, if I had always invoked thee in my temptations,
I should never have fallen. For the future I
shall never cease to invoke thee, saying: “Mary, help
me; Mary, succor me.” And do thou obtain for me
the grace always to invoke thee in the perils of my soul.</p>

<p>3d. “Sancta Dei genitrix:” Holy mother of God.
If the prayers of the saints avail much with God, how
much more will the prayers of Mary avail! The former
are the prayers of servants, but the latter are the
prayers of a mother. St. Antoninus says that the
prayer of Mary has the force of a command with
Jesus Christ: “Oratio Virginis habet rationem imperii;”
and hence he adds, that it is impossible for this
mother to ask a favor of the Son that the Son will not
grant her: “Impossibile est Deiparam non exaudiri.”
Therefore St. Bernard exhorts us to ask through Mary
for every grace that we wish from God: “Quæramus
gratiam, et per Mariam quæramus;” for she is the
mother, and is always graciously heard: “Quia mater
est, et frustrari non potest.” Oh great mother of
God, pray to Jesus for me. Look upon the miseries
of my soul, and have pity on me. Pray, and never
cease to pray for me until thou seest me safe in paradise.
Oh Mary, thou art my hope; do not abandon
me. Holy mother of God, pray for us: “Sancta Dei
genitrix, ora pro nobis.”</p>

<h5>SECOND DAY.</h5>

<p>1st. “Mater divinæ gratiæ:” Mother of divine
grace. Mary is called by St. Anselm: Mother of all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_730"></a>[730]</span>
graces: “Mater omnium gratiarum.” And by the
Idiot: Treasurer of divine grace: “Thesauraria gratiarum.”
Hence St. Bernardine of Sienna writes: All
the graces which we receive from God are dispensed
by the hand of Mary, and are dispensed to whom
Mary will, when she will, and as she will.<a id="FNanchor_1862" href="#Footnote_1862" class="fnanchor">[1862]</a> This she
herself says: “With me are riches and glory ...
that I may enrich them that love me.”<a id="FNanchor_1863" href="#Footnote_1863" class="fnanchor">[1863]</a> The Lord
has placed in my hand all the riches of his graces,
that I may enrich those who love me. Then, oh my
queen, if I love thee, I shall be no longer poor as I
am now. After my God, I love thee above all things;
do thou obtain for me greater tenderness and love for
thy goodness. St. Bonaventure tells me that every
one will be saved if thou wilt have him saved: “Quem
ipsa vis salvus erit.” And therefore will I say to thee
with the same saint: Oh salvation of those who invoke
thee, save me: “O salus te invocantium, salva
me.” Save me from hell, and first save me from sin,
which alone can bring me to hell.</p>

<p>2d. “Mater purissima:” Mother most pure. This
fair and pure virgin mother renders all her servants
chaste and pure. St. Ambrose writes that even when
Mary was on the earth, by her presence she inspired
with the love of purity all those who looked upon her.<a id="FNanchor_1864" href="#Footnote_1864" class="fnanchor">[1864]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_731"></a>[731]</span>
She was called the lily among thorns: “Sicut lilium
inter spinas sic amica mea inter filias.”<a id="FNanchor_1865" href="#Footnote_1865" class="fnanchor">[1865]</a> All other
virgins, says St. Denis the Carthusian, are thorns either
to themselves or to others; but the blessed Virgin
was neither a thorn to herself nor to others, for she
inspired with pure and holy affections all those who
beheld her. Moreover, Frigenius, author of the life of
St. Thomas Aquinas, writes, that this saint said that
even the image of this chaste turtle-dove extinguishes
the sensual emotions of him who looks upon it with
devotion. And the venerable John of Avila relates
that many persons, who were suffering from temptations
against purity, were preserved pure through the
devotion to our Lady. Oh, how especially powerful
is the name of Mary in conquering all temptations to
this vice! Oh Mary, most pure, free me from this
vice; make me always to have recourse to thee in
temptations, and invoke thee so long as the temptation
continues.</p>

<p>3d. “Mater inviolata:” Mother inviolate. Mary
was that immaculate woman who appeared in the eyes
of God all pure and spotless: “Tota pulchra es, amica
mea, et macula non est in te.”<a id="FNanchor_1866" href="#Footnote_1866" class="fnanchor">[1866]</a> Wherefore she
was called the reconciler of sinners, as St. Ephrem salutes
her: Hail, conciliatrix of the world: “Ave
conciliatrix orbis.” And as she herself said in the
Canticles: “Since I am become in his presence as
one finding peace.”<a id="FNanchor_1867" href="#Footnote_1867" class="fnanchor">[1867]</a> St. Gregory says that if a rebel<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_732"></a>[732]</span>
should appear before the offended king to appease
him, it would only provoke him the more to anger.
But Mary being destined to treat of peace between
God and men, it was not fitting that she should appear
as a partaker in the crime of Adam, and therefore
the Lord preserved Mary from every stain of sin.
Ah, my immaculate queen; oh spotless dove, so dear
to God; ah, do not disdain to look upon the many
stains and wounds of my soul; look on me and help
me. That God who loves thee so much, denies thee
nothing, neither dost thou know how to deny thyself
to him who invokes thee. Oh Mary, to thee I have
recourse; have pity on me. Mother inviolate, pray
for us: “Mater inviolata, ora pro nobis.”</p>

<h5>THIRD DAY.</h5>

<p>1st. “Mater amabilis:” Amiable mother. Richard
of St. Lawrence says that the blessed Virgin was
amiable in the eyes of God himself: “Fuit beata Virgo
amabilis oculis ipsius Dei.” Mary was so beautiful
in the eyes of God, that God was enamored of her
beauty. How beautiful art thou, my love! how beautiful
art thou! “Quam pulchra es, amica mea, quam
pulchra es.”<a id="FNanchor_1868" href="#Footnote_1868" class="fnanchor">[1868]</a> Hence he called her his only dove, his
only perfect one: One is my dove; my perfect one is but
one: “Una est columba mea, una est perfecta mea.”<a id="FNanchor_1869" href="#Footnote_1869" class="fnanchor">[1869]</a>
It is certain, as Father Suarez says, that God loves
Mary more than all the other saints together, and
justly, for she alone loved God more than all men and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_733"></a>[733]</span>
all the angels. Oh Mary, most pure; oh Mary,
most lovely, thou didst gain the heart of God; take
possession of my poor heart also, and make me holy.
I love thee, and I confide in thee. Amiable mother,
pray for us: “Mater amabilis, ora pro nobis.”</p>

<p>2d. “Mater Salvatoris:” Mother of the Saviour.
St. Bonaventure calls Mary the mediatrix of our salvation:
“Maria mediatrix nostræ salutis;” and St.
John Damascene: The deliverer of the world: “Salvatrix
mundi suo modo.” For two reasons, Mary may
be called the deliverer of the world and our mediatrix;
that is, mediatrix of grace, as Jesus Christ is the mediator
of justice. First, by the consent she gave to the
incarnation of the Word; for by such a consent, says
St. Bernardine, she procured for us salvation: “Per
hunc consensum omnium salutem procuravit.” Secondly,
by the consent which Mary gave to the death
of her Son, being willing that for our salvation, he
should be sacrificed on the cross. I will say to thee
then, oh mother of my Saviour, thou who once didst
offer to God the life of thy Son, save me now by thy
intercession.</p>

<p>3d. “Virgo veneranda:” Virgin most venerable.
St. Anselm declares, that when we say of Mary that
she is mother of God, we say that she surpasses in
greatness, after God, every thing that can be conceived
or expressed; whence he says to her: Oh Lady, nothing
is equal to thee; for every thing is either above
thee, and that is God; or it is beneath thee, and that
is every thing that is not God. In a word, St. Bernardine<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_734"></a>[734]</span>
says that God alone can know the greatness
of Mary;<a id="FNanchor_1870" href="#Footnote_1870" class="fnanchor">[1870]</a> and the blessed Albertus Magnus affirms
that Mary could not be more united to God except
by becoming God: “Magis Deo conjungi non potuit,
nisi fieret Deus.” Truly worthy then of our veneration
is this great mother of God, for God himself could
not make her greater than he has done, by making her
his mother. Oh, mother of God, and my mother,
Mary, I adore thee, and would wish thee to be adored
by all hearts, as that exalted Lady thou art. Have
mercy on a poor sinner, who loves thee and trusts in
thee. Virgin most venerable, pray for us: “Virgo
veneranda, ora pro nobis.”</p>

<h5>FOURTH DAY.</h5>

<p>1st. “Virgo prædicanda:” Virgin to be praised. The
holy Church sings that this divine mother is worthy
of all praise: “Omni laude dignissima;” for according
to St. Ildephonsus, all praise that is given to the
blessed Virgin is an honor paid to her Son: “Refunditur
in filium quod impenditur matri.” With reason,
then, did St. George of Nicomedia declare that the
praises given to Mary God accepts, as if offered to
himself.<a id="FNanchor_1871" href="#Footnote_1871" class="fnanchor">[1871]</a> The holy Virgin promises paradise to him
who endeavors to make her known and loved.<a id="FNanchor_1872" href="#Footnote_1872" class="fnanchor">[1872]</a> Richard<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_735"></a>[735]</span>
of St. Lawrence says that Mary will honor in
eternity those who honor her in this life.<a id="FNanchor_1873" href="#Footnote_1873" class="fnanchor">[1873]</a> St. Anselm
says, that as Mary, by being mother of God, was the
means of saving sinners, so sinners receive salvation by
proclaiming the praises of Mary. Not all can be
preachers; but all can praise her, and tell others, when
speaking familiarly with relatives and friends, of the
merits of Mary, of her power and her mercy, and thus
induce them to become servants of this divine mother.
Oh queen of heaven, from this day I wish to do all
that I can to make thee venerated and loved by all.
Accept this my desire, and help me to fulfil it; in the
mean time admit me among the number of thy servants,
and no longer permit me to be a slave of Lucifer.</p>

<p>2d. “Virgo potens:” Virgin most powerful. And
who among the saints is so powerful with God as his
most holy mother? She obtains whatever she wishes, as
St. Bernard has said: It is enough that thou dost wish,
and all things are done: “Velis tu et omnia fient.”
St. Peter Damian even says that when Mary asks
graces from God she does not pray, but in a certain
manner commands.<a id="FNanchor_1874" href="#Footnote_1874" class="fnanchor">[1874]</a> Thus the Son honors this mother
whom he loves so much, by granting her whatever
she asks, even favors for sinners. Hence St.
Germanus says: Thou art the mother of God, omnipotent
to save sinners, and thou hast no need of any
other recommendation with God, for thou art the mother<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_736"></a>[736]</span>
of true life. Oh, Mary thou canst make me
holy; in thee I trust.</p>

<p>3d. “Virgo clemens:” Most clement Virgin. As
Mary is powerful with God, so is she clement and
merciful towards those who have recourse to her intercession.
Neither the power nor the will is wanting
to her, as St. Bernard says: “Nec facultas, nec voluntas
illi deesse potest.” The power to save us cannot
be wanting to Mary, for she is mother of God;
neither can the will be wanting to aid us, for she is our
mother. And who has ever had recourse to Mary
and been abandoned? Let him cease to praise thy
mercy, says again St. Bernard, who remembers having
ever invoked thee without being heard.<a id="FNanchor_1875" href="#Footnote_1875" class="fnanchor">[1875]</a> St. Bonaventure
asserts that the desire of Mary to be invoked
by us, in order that she may dispense to us her
favors more abundantly, is so great, that she not only
considers herself offended by those who injure her, but
also by those who do not ask favors of her.<a id="FNanchor_1876" href="#Footnote_1876" class="fnanchor">[1876]</a> Thus
it is not needful to pray long to this mother of mercy,
in order to obtain her aid; it is enough to ask it of
her with confidence. Her clemency comes to our aid
before we invoke it, as Richard of St. Victor says:
“Velocius occurrit ejus pietas, quam invocetur;” and
he gives us the reason, saying: She cannot see our miseries,
and not be moved by them: “Non potest miserias<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_737"></a>[737]</span>
scire, et non subvenire.” Behold, then, oh
Mary, behold my miseries, and succor me: “Virgo
clemens, ora pro nobis.”</p>

<h5>FIFTH DAY.</h5>

<p>1st. “Virgo fidelis:” Virgin most faithful. Blessed
is he who, with his prayers, watches at the gates
of Mary, as the poor wait at the gates of the rich to
obtain relief! “Blessed is the man,” as she herself
says, “that heareth me, and that watcheth daily at
my gates!”<a id="FNanchor_1877" href="#Footnote_1877" class="fnanchor">[1877]</a> Oh, that we were faithful in serving
this divine mother, as she is faithful in succoring us
when we pray to her! Mary promises to those who
serve and honor her, that they shall be freed from
sins, and shall obtain eternal salvation. “They that
work by me shall not sin.... They that explain me
shall have life everlasting.”<a id="FNanchor_1878" href="#Footnote_1878" class="fnanchor">[1878]</a> She invites all to come
to her, and promises them every grace that they
hope for. “In me is all grace of the way and of the
truth; in me is all hope of life and of virtue ... come
over to me all.”<a id="FNanchor_1879" href="#Footnote_1879" class="fnanchor">[1879]</a> St. Lawrence Justinian applies to
Mary that other text of Ecclesiasticus: Her bands are
a healthful binding: “Vincula illius alligatura salutaris;”<a id="FNanchor_1880" href="#Footnote_1880" class="fnanchor">[1880]</a>
and then adds: “Wherefore bands? unless<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_738"></a>[738]</span>
to bind her servants, that they may not go astray into
unlawful fields.”<a id="FNanchor_1881" href="#Footnote_1881" class="fnanchor">[1881]</a> Mary binds her servants that they
may not take too much liberty, and thus cause
their own ruin. Oh mother of God, in thee I place
all my hopes: thou must save me from falling again
into sin. Oh my Lady, do not abandon me; obtain
for me the grace to die rather than to lose the grace
of God.</p>

<p>2d. “Causa nostræ latitiæ:” Cause of our joy.
As after the darkness and gloom of night, the dawn
is the cause of joy, thus after the darkness of sin,
which for four thousand years before the coming of
Jesus Christ had prevailed on earth, the birth of Mary,
our Aurora, brought joy to the world. When Mary
was born, the morning rose, says a holy Father: “Nata
Maria, surrexit Aurora.” The dawn is the precursor of
the sun, and Mary was the precursor of the incarnate
Word, the Sun of Justice and our Redeemer, who
by his death, freed us from eternal death. With
reason does the Church sing of the nativity of Mary:
“Thy birth, oh holy mother of God, announced joy
to the whole world.”<a id="FNanchor_1882" href="#Footnote_1882" class="fnanchor">[1882]</a> And as Mary was the beginning
of our joy, so is she also the completion of it;
for St. Bernard says that Jesus Christ has placed the
whole treasure of his merits in the hands of his mother,
so that every good we receive we may receive through<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_739"></a>[739]</span>
Mary.<a id="FNanchor_1883" href="#Footnote_1883" class="fnanchor">[1883]</a> Oh mother of God, thou art my joy and my
hope, for thou dost refuse thy favor to none, and thou
dost obtain from God whatever thou dost wish.</p>

<p>3d. “Vas insigne devotionis:” Vessel of singular
devotion. Devotion, as St. Thomas teaches, consists
in the readiness of our will to conform to the will of
God. This readiness was the principal virtue that
rendered his most holy mother so dear to God. And
this we are given to understand by the answer of our
Lord to the woman who called blessed the womb that
bore him: “Yea rather, blessed are they that hear
the word of God and keep it.”<a id="FNanchor_1884" href="#Footnote_1884" class="fnanchor">[1884]</a> By this, according
to Bede, the Lord intended to say, that Mary was
more happy by the union of her will with that of
God, than by being his mother. That flower which
always turns towards the sun is a true type of Mary.
The divine will alone was the only aim and satisfaction
of the heart of Mary, as she herself sang: “My
spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour.”<a id="FNanchor_1885" href="#Footnote_1885" class="fnanchor">[1885]</a> Oh, blessed
art thou, my Lady, who wast always and entirely
united to the divine will! Obtain for me the grace to
live, for the remainder of my life, always in uniformity
with the will of God.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_740"></a>[740]</span></p>

<h5>SIXTH DAY.</h5>

<p>1st. “Rosa mystica:” Mystical rose. It is said
of Mary, in the holy Canticles, that she was the inclosed
garden of God: “Hortus conclusus soror mea
sponsa.”<a id="FNanchor_1886" href="#Footnote_1886" class="fnanchor">[1886]</a> And St. Bernard, explaining this passage,
says that the Lord planted in this garden all the
flowers that adorn the Church, and among others the
violet of humility, the lily of purity, and the rose of
charity. The rose is red; and therefore Mary is called
the rose, according to the Idiot, on account of the
ardent charity with which her heart was always inflamed
towards God, and towards us.<a id="FNanchor_1887" href="#Footnote_1887" class="fnanchor">[1887]</a> And where
can we find an advocate who is more occupied with
our salvation, and who loves us more than Mary?
We acknowledge that one alone in heaven is solicitous
for us, as St. Augustine says of her.<a id="FNanchor_1888" href="#Footnote_1888" class="fnanchor">[1888]</a> Oh my dear
mother, if I could love thee as thou lovest me! I
will not, however, fail of doing what I can to honor
and love thee; my sweet Lady, obtain for me the
grace to be faithful to thee.</p>

<p>2d. “Turris Davidica:” Tower of David. Mary is
called, in the holy Canticles, Tower of David: “Thy
neck is as the tower of David; a thousand bucklers
hang upon it, all the armor of valiant men.”<a id="FNanchor_1889" href="#Footnote_1889" class="fnanchor">[1889]</a> St.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_741"></a>[741]</span>
Bernardine says, that the tower of David stood on
high, that is, on Sion; and therefore Mary is called
“The Tower of David,” to denote the elevation of this
great creature: as Sion was a most lofty place, so the
blessed Virgin was most exalted.<a id="FNanchor_1890" href="#Footnote_1890" class="fnanchor">[1890]</a> Hence, of Mary
it is said in the Psalms, that her sanctity in the beginning
was more exalted than the mountains: “Fundamenta
ejus in montibus sanctis.”<a id="FNanchor_1891" href="#Footnote_1891" class="fnanchor">[1891]</a> St. Gregory explains
it by saying, that the divine mother was more
holy in the first moments of her life than the saints
have been at the moment of their death. Oh my
queen and mother, I rejoice in thy greatness, and am
ready to give my life that thy glory should not be
diminished in the least degree, if it were possible that
it could be diminished. Oh, that I might give all my
blood to cause all the nations of the earth to honor
and love thee as the Lady thou art!</p>

<p>3d. “Turris eburnea:” Tower of ivory. Thus
Mary is also called: Thy neck is as a tower of ivory:
“Collum tuum sicut turris eburnea.”<a id="FNanchor_1892" href="#Footnote_1892" class="fnanchor">[1892]</a> Mary is called
the neck, for she is the mystic neck through whom
from the head, Jesus Christ, are transmitted to us the
faithful, who are the members of the mystic body of
the Church, the vital spirits, namely, the divine help
which preserves in us the life of grace. In the words
of St. Bernardine: Through the Virgin, the life-giving
graces flow from Christ, the head, into his mystic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_742"></a>[742]</span>
body.<a id="FNanchor_1893" href="#Footnote_1893" class="fnanchor">[1893]</a> The saint adds, that from the time when Mary
conceived in her womb the incarnate Word, she received
from God such honor, that no one could receive
any grace except through her hands. Ivory, in
a word, is smooth and strong, hence Rupert the Abbot
writes of Mary: As a tower of ivory, beautiful in the
eye of God, terrible to the devil.<a id="FNanchor_1894" href="#Footnote_1894" class="fnanchor">[1894]</a> Thou, then, oh
my Lady, because thou art so beloved by God, canst
obtain for us every blessing; and because thou art
terrible to demons, thou canst liberate us from all
their snares. Have pity on us, for we glory in living
under thy protection.</p>

<h5>SEVENTH DAY.</h5>

<p>1st. “Domus aurea:” House of gold. Gold is the
symbol of love. Hence the blessed Albertus Magnus
calls Mary, The golden temple of charity: “Templum
aureum charitatis.” And with reason; for St. Thomas
says, that as every thing in the temple was covered
with gold, so the beautiful soul of Mary was filled
with sanctity.<a id="FNanchor_1895" href="#Footnote_1895" class="fnanchor">[1895]</a> Mary was that house of gold which
the Eternal Wisdom, that is the divine Word, chose
for his habitation on this earth: Wisdom hath built
herself a house: “Sapientia ædificavit sibi domum.”<a id="FNanchor_1896" href="#Footnote_1896" class="fnanchor">[1896]</a>
Now this house of God, says Richard of St. Lawrence,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_743"></a>[743]</span>
is so rich that it can relieve all our miseries.<a id="FNanchor_1897" href="#Footnote_1897" class="fnanchor">[1897]</a> Oh
Mary, thou dost love God so much that thou dost
desire to see him beloved by all. This is the grace
that above all others I ask of thee, and hope from thee;
obtain from me a great love to God.</p>

<p>2d. “Fœderis arca:” Ark of the covenant. Ischio
calls Mary: An ark more spacious than that of Noe:
“Arca Noe largior:” for in that only two animals of
each kind were received, but under the mantle of
Mary all find room, both just and sinners. This was
one day revealed to St. Gertrude, who saw a multitude
of wild beasts, lions, leopards, &amp;c., who took
refuge under the mantle of Mary; and she did not
drive them away, but with kind hand caressed them,
so that they might not fly away. The brutes who
entered into the ark remained brutes; but sinners,
who take shelter under the mantle of Mary, do not
remain sinners. She will certainly change their hearts
and render them dear to God. The Virgin herself
revealed to St. Bridget: “However a man may have
sinned, if with a true purpose of amendment he returns
to me, I am ready at once to receive him;
neither do I look upon the sins with which he is laden,
but only whether he comes with good dispositions;
and then I do not disdain to bind up and heal
his wounds, for I am called, and truly am, the mother
of mercy.” Oh mother of mercy, I will then say to
thee with St. Augustine, remember that it has never<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_744"></a>[744]</span>
been known that a sinner was rejected by thee, who
had recourse to thee for help; I, a miserable sinner,
invoke thee and trust in thee.</p>

<p>3d. “Janua cœli:” Gate of heaven. Mary is called
the gate of heaven, because no one can enter into
heaven, as St. Bonaventure declares, except through
Mary.<a id="FNanchor_1898" href="#Footnote_1898" class="fnanchor">[1898]</a> In Jerusalem is my power: “In Jerusalem
potestas mea,” says our queen.<a id="FNanchor_1899" href="#Footnote_1899" class="fnanchor">[1899]</a> And Richard of St.
Lawrence adds: Commanding what I will, and introducing
whom I will: “Imperando quod volo, et quos
volo introducendo.” I can obtain whatever I wish for
my servants, and introduce whom I will into paradise.
Therefore St. Bonaventure says: Those who enjoy
the favor of Mary, are recognized as citizens of paradise;
and those who are like her, that is, have the
grace to be her servants, are written in the book of
life. For this reason Bernardine de Bustis calls Mary
the book of life, and says that he who through devotion
to her finds himself written in this book, will
certainly be saved. Ah, my mother, in thee I place
the hopes of my eternal salvation. I love thee, save
thou me; do not permit a servant of thine who loves
thee to go to blaspheme thee in hell.</p>

<h5>EIGHTH DAY.</h5>

<p>1st. “Stella matutina:” Morning star. Mary is
called by St. John Damascene: The star that precedes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_745"></a>[745]</span>
the sun: “Stella demonstrans solem.” As the
morning star precedes the sun, so devotion to the holy
Virgin precedes the sun of divine grace; and St. Germanus
says, that devotion towards Mary in a soul, is
a sign that it is, or soon will be, in the state of grace.
By the Church our Lady is also called: “The star of the
sea;” for, as St. Thomas explains it, as in the time of
tempest mariners are guided into port by the star, so
by Mary we are guided over the sea of this world to
paradise.<a id="FNanchor_1900" href="#Footnote_1900" class="fnanchor">[1900]</a> Therefore St. Bernard gives us this advice:
If you do not wish to be overwhelmed by the
tempest of temptations, do not turn your eyes from
this star of salvation.<a id="FNanchor_1901" href="#Footnote_1901" class="fnanchor">[1901]</a> And then he adds: Following
Mary, you cannot go astray; if Mary protects you,
you cannot fear being lost; if Mary favors you, you
will arrive at paradise.</p>

<p>2d. “Salus infirmorum:” Health of the weak.
Mary is called by St. Simon Stock: The medicine of
sinners: “Peccatorum medicina;” and by St. Ephrem,
not only medicine, but health itself: Firm health for
those who have recourse to her: “Salus firma recurrentium
ad eam.”<a id="FNanchor_1902" href="#Footnote_1902" class="fnanchor">[1902]</a> For he who has recourse to Mary
not only finds medicine, but he finds health, as she
herself promises to him who seeks her: “He that
shall find me shall find life, and shall have salvation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_746"></a>[746]</span>
from the Lord.”<a id="FNanchor_1903" href="#Footnote_1903" class="fnanchor">[1903]</a> Neither should we fear that on
account of the loathsomeness of our wounds she will
refuse to take care of us. She is our mother, and as a
mother does not shrink from taking care of a child
covered with wounds, so this celestial physician does
not refuse to cure her servants who have recourse to
her. Wherefore St. Bernard says: Oh mother of
God, thou hast no horror of a sinner, however loathsome
he may be; if he sighs for thee, thou wilt rescue
him with thine own hand from despair.</p>

<p>3d. “Refugium peccatorum:” Refuge of sinners.
Thus Mary is called by St. Germanus: The refuge,
ever ready, for all sinners: “Refugium paratissimum
peccatorum;” for the Idiot says, that she cannot reject
any sinner, but as soon as he has recourse to her,
Mary receives him.<a id="FNanchor_1904" href="#Footnote_1904" class="fnanchor">[1904]</a> Hence St. John Damascene
calls Mary not only the refuge of the innocent, but
also of the bad who implore her protection.<a id="FNanchor_1905" href="#Footnote_1905" class="fnanchor">[1905]</a> And
St. Anselm also says: Thou dost embrace with maternal
love the sinner who is despised by the whole
world, neither dost thou leave the wretched until thou
hast reconciled them to their God.<a id="FNanchor_1906" href="#Footnote_1906" class="fnanchor">[1906]</a> By which he
gives us to understand that the sinner, being hated by
God, is rendered odious and abominable in the eyes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_747"></a>[747]</span>
of all creatures; but if he has recourse to the refuge
of sinners, Mary not only does not despise him, but
affectionately embraces him, and does not abandon
him until he is pardoned by her Son and our Judge,
Jesus Christ. Then, oh my Lady, if thou art the
refuge of all sinners, thou art also my refuge. Thou
who dost not despise any one who has recourse to
thee, do not despise me, for to thee I recommend
myself: “Refugium peccatorum, ora pro nobis.” Oh
Mary, pray for us, and save us.</p>

<h5>NINTH DAY.</h5>

<p>1st. “Consolatrix afflictorum:” Comforter of the
afflicted. St. Germanus writes: Oh Mary, who has
so great care of our welfare as thou hast? Is there
any one who relieves us in our afflictions as thou
dost?<a id="FNanchor_1907" href="#Footnote_1907" class="fnanchor">[1907]</a> No, replies St. Antoninus: There is none
among the saints who compassionates our miseries as
this most pious Lady.<a id="FNanchor_1908" href="#Footnote_1908" class="fnanchor">[1908]</a> And because the miseries
which most afflict us are the maladies of the soul, the
blessed Henry Suso calls Mary: The most faithful
consoler of sinners: “Consolatrix fidelissima peccatorum.”
We need only show to Mary the wounds of
our souls, and she immediately comes to our aid with
her prayers, and consoles us. Even as Richard of St.
Victor teaches, her piety prevents us and relieves us<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_748"></a>[748]</span>
before we invoke her: “Velocius occurrit quam invocetur.”
Let us say to her, then, with St. Bonaventure:
Oh Mary, always console us, but especially at
the hour of our death. Come, then, and take our souls,
and present them to thy Son, who is to be our Judge.</p>

<p>2d. “Auxilium Christianorum:” Help of Christians.
St. John of Damascus calls her: Aid prepared and
ready to free us from all dangers.<a id="FNanchor_1909" href="#Footnote_1909" class="fnanchor">[1909]</a> The help of Mary
is, as St. Cosmas of Jerusalem declares, omnipotent
to save us from sin and from hell. St. Bernard addressed
her in these words: Thou art invincible in the
defence of thy servants: “Tu bellatrix egregia,” doing
battle with the demons who assail them. And for
this reason Mary is called in the sacred Canticles:
Terrible as an army set in array: “Terribilis ut castrorum
acies ordinata.”<a id="FNanchor_1910" href="#Footnote_1910" class="fnanchor">[1910]</a> Ah, my queen, if I had
always had recourse to thee I should never have been
conquered by my enemies. From henceforth thou
must be my strength; in my temptations I will always
invoke thee, and from thee I hope for victory.</p>

<p>3d. “Regina martyrum:” Queen of martyrs. Mary
is justly called Queen of martyrs; for her martyrdom,
in the death of her Son on the cross, exceeded the
sufferings of all the martyrs. And there stood by the
cross of Jesus his mother: “Stabat juxta crucem
mater ejus.” Mothers fly from their children when
they see them dying before their eyes and cannot help<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_749"></a>[749]</span>
them; Mary does not fly, but remains with Jesus until
she sees him expire: “Stabat juxta crucem.” And
while Jesus is in his agony she is offering to the eternal
Father the life of her Son for our salvation; but
in offering it she also endures the agony of death, and
experiences a suffering greater than that of every
death. Oh my afflicted mother, by the merit of the
sufferings thou didst endure at the foot of the cross,
obtain for me a true sorrow for my sins and love for
Jesus my Redeemer. And by that sword which
pierced thy heart when thou didst see him bow his
head and expire, I pray thee to assist me at the moment
of my death, and obtain for me then eternal
salvation, that I may come to love thee forever with
thy Son Jesus.</p>

<h5 id="MEDITATIONS">MEDITATION<br>
<i>For the day of the Purification of Mary and the Presentation of Jesus.</i></h5>

<p>1st. The time having arrived when Mary was to
go, according to the law, to be purified in the temple
and to present Jesus to the divine Father, she departed
with Joseph. Joseph took the two turtle-doves that
were to be offered, and Mary takes her dear infant—she
takes the divine Lamb to offer him to God as a
sign of that great sacrifice which this Son was one day
to complete upon the cross. Oh my God, I also unite<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_750"></a>[750]</span>
made man, and by his merits I pray thee to give me
thy grace. I do not merit it, but Jesus, to obtain it
for me, has sacrificed himself to thee. For love then
of Jesus, have pity on me.</p>

<p>2d. Behold, Mary enters into the temple and makes
the oblation of her Son in the name of the whole human
race. But especially on this day does Jesus offer
himself to his eternal Father: Behold me, he says, oh
my Father, to thee I consecrate my whole life: thou
hast sent me into the world to save it; behold my
blood and my life, I offer all to thee for the salvation
of the world. Unhappy should I be, my dear Redeemer,
if thou hadst not satisfied for me the divine
justice. I thank thee for it with my whole soul, and
I love thee with my whole heart. And whom should
I love if I do not love a God who has sacrificed his
life for me?</p>

<p>3d. This sacrifice was more dear to God than if all
men and all the angels had offered to him their lives.
Yes, because in this offering alone of Jesus the eternal
Father received an infinite honor and an infinite
satisfaction. Jesus Christ once said to the blessed
Angela of Foligno: “I have offered myself for thee
that thou mayest offer thyself to me.” Yes, my Jesus,
as thou didst offer to the Father thy life for me,
I offer to thee my life and my whole self. Hitherto I
have with so great ingratitude slighted thee, but thou
hast promised to forget the offences of a sinner who
repents of having offended thee; my Jesus, I grieve
for it, and I wish to die of grief. I was dead in sin;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_751"></a>[751]</span>
from thee I hope for life, and my life will be to love
thee, oh Infinite Good. Grant that I may love thee,
and I will ask of thee nothing more. Dispense the
goods of this earth to those who desire them; I desire
nothing but the treasure of thy love. My Jesus,
thou art alone enough for me. Oh my queen and
mother Mary, through thee I hope every good.</p>

<h5>MEDITATION<br>
<i>For the Day of the Annunciation to Mary.</i></h5>

<p>1st. When God wished to send his Son to make himself
man that he might redeem lost man, he chose for
him a virgin mother, among all virgins the most pure, the
most holy, and the most humble. And behold, whilst
Mary was in her poor little dwelling praying to God
for the coming of the Redeemer, an angel appears and
salutes her, and says to her: “Hail, full of grace, the
Lord is with thee; blessed art thou among women.”<a id="FNanchor_1911" href="#Footnote_1911" class="fnanchor">[1911]</a>
And what does the humble Virgin when she hears
such words in her honor? She is not elated, but is
silent and troubled, esteeming herself too unworthy of
these praises. She was troubled at his saying: “Turbata
est in sermone ejus.”<a id="FNanchor_1912" href="#Footnote_1912" class="fnanchor">[1912]</a> Oh Mary, thou so humble
and I so proud, obtain for me holy humility.</p>

<p>2d. Did not those praises, at least, cause Mary to suspect
that she was the destined mother of the Redeemer?<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_752"></a>[752]</span>
No, they only caused her to conceive a
great fear of herself. Wherefore it was necessary
that the angel should encourage her not to be afraid:
“Fear not, Mary, for thou hast found grace with
God.”<a id="FNanchor_1913" href="#Footnote_1913" class="fnanchor">[1913]</a> And then he announced to her that she was
chosen to be the mother of the Saviour of the world:
“Behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and shalt
bring forth a Son, and thou shalt call his name Jesus.”<a id="FNanchor_1914" href="#Footnote_1914" class="fnanchor">[1914]</a>
Blessed art thou, oh Mary! how dear thou wast and
art to thy God! Have pity on me.</p>

<p>3d. Take courage, says St. Bernard, addressing her;
why delay, holy Virgin, in giving thy consent? The
eternal Word awaits it, in order to clothe himself with
flesh, and become thy Son. We, who are all condemned
to eternal death, are waiting for it in misery;
if thou dost accept and consent to be his mother, we
shall all be delivered. Quickly, oh Lady, answer; do
not delay giving to the world that salvation which depends
on thy consent. But rejoice, for Mary already
answers to the angel: Behold, she says, the servant
of the Lord, bound to do whatever her Lord commands:<a id="FNanchor_1915" href="#Footnote_1915" class="fnanchor">[1915]</a>
if he chooses a servant for his mother, the
servant is not to be praised, but only the goodness of
God, who wishes thus to honor her. Oh Mary, most
humble, thou, by thy humility, hast so enamored thy
God that thou hast constrained him to make himself<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_753"></a>[753]</span>
thy Son and our Redeemer. I know that thy Son
denies thee nothing that thou dost ask; ask of him to
give me his holy love; ask of him to pardon me all
the offences which I have committed against him;
ask of him to give me perseverance until death. In a
word, recommend to him my soul, for thy recommendations
are never rejected by a Son who loves thee so
much. Oh Mary, thou must save me; thou art my
hope.</p>

<h5>MEDITATION FOR THE SECOND DAY OF JULY.<br>
<i>On the Feast of the Visitation of Mary.</i></h5>

<p>1st. Mary set out from Nazareth to go to the city of
Hebron, distant, according to Broccardo, seventy miles;
that is to say, at least seven days’ journey over rough
mountains and with no other companion than her
spouse Joseph. The holy Virgin hastens, as St.
Luke informs us: She went into the mountainous
country in haste: “Abiit in montana cum festinatione.”<a id="FNanchor_1916" href="#Footnote_1916" class="fnanchor">[1916]</a>
Tell us, oh holy Lady, why thou didst undertake
this long and difficult journey, and why thou
didst thus hasten on thy way? I am going, she answers,
to exercise my office of charity; I am going to
console a family. If, then, oh great mother of God,
thy office is to console and dispense graces to souls,
ah come to console and visit also my soul. Thy visit
then sanctified the house of Elizabeth; come, oh Mary,
and sanctify me also.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_754"></a>[754]</span></p>

<p>2d. And now the holy Virgin has arrived at the
house of Elizabeth. She had been made mother of
God, but she is the first to salute her relation. She
entered, and saluted Elizabeth: Intravit et salutavit
Elizabeth. Elizabeth, enlightened by the Lord, already
knows that the divine Word had become man
and the Son of Mary; hence she calls her blessed
among women, and blesses that divine fruit that was
in her womb: “Blessed art thou among women, and
blessed is the fruit of thy womb.”<a id="FNanchor_1917" href="#Footnote_1917" class="fnanchor">[1917]</a> And, filled (at the
same time) with confusion and joy, she exclaims: “And
whence is this to me that the mother of my Lord should
come to me?”<a id="FNanchor_1918" href="#Footnote_1918" class="fnanchor">[1918]</a> But what does the humble Mary answer
to these words? She answers: My soul doth
magnify the Lord: “Magnificat anima mea Dominum.”
As if she would say: Ah, Elizabeth, you praise me;
but I praise my God that he has chosen to exalt me,
his poor servant, to be his mother: he hath regarded
the humility of his servant: “Respexit humilitatem
ancillæ suæ.” Oh most holy Mary, since thou dost
dispense so many graces to those who ask them of thee,
I pray thee to give me thy humility. Thou dost esteem
thyself as nothing before God; but I am worse
than nothing, for I am, at the same time, nothing and
a sinner. Thou canst make me humble. Make me so
through love of that God who has made thee his mother.</p>

<p>3d. But at the first words of Mary, when she salutes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_755"></a>[755]</span>
Elizabeth, what happens? The child, John, exults
with joy on account of the divine grace given him
before his birth;<a id="FNanchor_1919" href="#Footnote_1919" class="fnanchor">[1919]</a> Elizabeth is filled with the Holy
Spirit, and Zachary, the father of the Baptist, not long
after, is consoled by recovering his speech. So that it
is indeed true, oh my queen and mother, that through
thee the divine graces are dispensed, and souls are
sanctified. Do not forget, then, oh my most dear
Lady, me, thy poor servant, who love thee, and have
placed in thee all my hopes. Thy prayers are all graciously
heard by that God who loves thee so much.
Pray, then, for me, oh my mother, and make me holy.</p>

<h5>MEDITATION FOR THE FIFTEENTH DAY OF AUGUST.<br>
<i>On the Feast of the Assumption of Mary into Heaven.</i></h5>

<p>1st. Mary dies; but how does she die? She dies
entirely detached from any affection for created things,
and dies consumed with that divine love with which her
most holy heart was always and entirely inflamed.
Oh holy mother, thou hast already left the earth; do
not forget us, miserable pilgrims, who remain in this
valley of tears struggling against so many enemies, who
desire to see us lost in hell. Ah, by the merits of thy
precious death, obtain for us detachment from earthly
things, pardon of our sins, love to God, and holy perseverance;
and, when the hour of our death shall arrive,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_756"></a>[756]</span>
assist us from heaven with thy prayers, and obtain
for us to come and kiss thy feet in paradise.</p>

<p>2d. Mary dies, and her most pure body is carried
by the holy apostles, and placed in the sepulchre, and
is guarded by angels for three days, after which it is
transported to paradise; but her beautiful soul entered,
as soon as she expired, the kingdom of the blessed,
accompanied by innumerable angels and by her Son
himself. Having entered heaven, she humbly presents
herself to God, adores him, and, with unbounded
love, thanks him for all the graces which she has received
from him. God embraces her, blesses her, and
constitutes her queen of the universe, exalting her
above all the angels and saints.<a id="FNanchor_1920" href="#Footnote_1920" class="fnanchor">[1920]</a> Now, if the human
mind, as the apostle says, cannot arrive at the comprehension
of the great glory that God is preparing in
heaven for his servants who have loved him on this
earth, what must be the glory that he gave to this his
most holy mother, who on earth has loved him more
than all the saints and angels, and has loved him with
all her power! So that Mary alone, when she entered
heaven, could say to God: Oh my Lord, if I have not
loved thee on earth as thou dost merit, at least I have
loved thee as much as I could.</p>

<p>3d. Let us rejoice with Mary in the glory with
which her God has enriched her; and let us also
rejoice for ourselves, for Mary, at the same time
was made queen of the world, and appointed our advocate.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_757"></a>[757]</span>
She is so merciful an advocate, that she
consents to defend all sinners who recommend themselves
to her; and she is so powerful with our Judge
that she gains all the causes which she defends. Oh
our queen and advocate, in thy hand is our salvation;
if thou dost pray for us, we shall be saved.
Say to thy Son that thou dost wish us with thee in
paradise. He denies thee nothing that thou dost ask.
Oh our life, our sweetness, and our hope! Mary, pray
Jesus for us.</p>

<h5>MEDITATION FOR THE EIGHTH DAY OF SEPTEMBER.<br>
<i>On the Feast of the Nativity of Mary.</i></h5>

<p>1st. Before the birth of Mary the world was lost
in the darkness of sin. Mary was born, and the
morning arose: “Nata Maria, surrexit aurora,” says
a holy Father. Already it had been said of Mary:
“Who is she that cometh forth as the morning
rising?”<a id="FNanchor_1921" href="#Footnote_1921" class="fnanchor">[1921]</a> As the earth rejoices when the day dawns,
for the dawn is the precursor of the sun, so Mary at
her birth gave joy to the whole world, for she was
the precursor of the sun of justice, Jesus Christ, who
being made her son, came to save us by his death;
therefore the Church sings: “Thy nativity, oh virgin
mother of God, announced joy to the whole world, for
from thee the sun of justice has arisen, who has given<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_758"></a>[758]</span>
us life eternal.”<a id="FNanchor_1922" href="#Footnote_1922" class="fnanchor">[1922]</a> Thus, when Mary was born, we received
our remedy, our consolation, and our salvation;
for through Mary we have received the Saviour.</p>

<p>2d. This child being then destined for the mother
of the eternal Word, God bestowed on her so much
grace, that even from her immaculate conception her
sanctity excelled the sanctity of all the saints and
angels united, for she received a grace of a superior
order, corresponding to the dignity of mother of God.
Oh holy infant, oh full of grace, I, a miserable sinner,
salute thee and adore thee. Thou art the beloved,
the delight of God; have pity on me, who through
my sins have been hateful and abominable in the eyes
of God. Thou, oh most pure Virgin, hast so well
known even from thy infancy how to gain the heart
of God, that he denies thee nothing, and grants all
that thou dost ask of him. In thee then I place my
hopes. Recommend me to thy Son, and I shall be
saved.</p>

<p>3d. At the same time that Mary was destined to be
the mother of our Redeemer, she was also destined to
be the mediatrix between God and us sinners. Hence
the Angelic Doctor, St. Thomas, says, that Mary received
grace sufficient to save all men; and therefore
St. Bernard calls Mary a channel so full that we can
all partake of its fulness.<a id="FNanchor_1923" href="#Footnote_1923" class="fnanchor">[1923]</a> Oh my queen, oh mediatrix<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_759"></a>[759]</span>
of sinners, perform thy office and intercede for
me! Let not my sins prevent me from confiding in
thee, oh great mother of God; no, I trust in thee, and
trust in thee so much, that if my salvation were in my
own hands, yet I would place it all in thine. Oh Mary,
receive me under thy protection, and this is enough
for me.</p>

<h5>MEDITATION FOR THE TWENTY-FIRST DAY OF NOVEMBER.<br>
<i>On the Feast of the Presentation of Mary.</i></h5>

<p>1st. The holy child Mary, having hardly arrived at
the age of three years, entreated her parents that she
might be placed in the temple according to the promise
which they had made. The day appointed having
arrived, the immaculate young Virgin leaves Nazareth
with St. Joachim and St. Anna, accompanied by a
host of angels who attend that holy child who was
destined for the mother of their Creator. Go, says
St. Germanus, go, oh blessed Virgin, to the house of
the Lord, to await the Holy Spirit, who is to come to
render thee mother of the eternal Word.</p>

<p>2d. The holy company having arrived at the temple
in Jerusalem, the holy child turns to her parents, and
kneeling, kisses their hands, asks their blessing, and
then, without looking back, ascends the steps of the
temple. There renouncing entirely the world and all
things that the world could give her, she offers and
consecrates herself wholly to God. Henceforth the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_760"></a>[760]</span>
life of Mary in the temple was but one continual exercise
of love, and the offering of her whole self to her
Lord. She increased from hour to hour, nay, from moment
to moment, in holy virtues, sustained indeed by
divine grace, but always endeavoring, with all her
powers, to correspond with grace. Mary herself revealed
this to St. Elizabeth, the virgin, saying: “Do
you think that I obtained the graces and virtues without
an effort? Know that I received from God no
grace without great effort, continual prayer, an ardent
desire, and many tears and penances.”</p>

<p>3d. Thus Mary, a young virgin in the temple, did
nothing but pray. And seeing the human race lost
and hateful to God, she especially prayed for the
coming of the Messias, desiring then to be the servant
of that happy Virgin who was to be the mother
of God. Oh, who would have said to her then: Oh
holy Lady, know that already through thy prayers
the Son of God is hastening to come and redeem the
world; and know that thou art the blessed one chosen
to be the mother of thy Creator. Oh beloved of God,
most holy child, thou prayest for all, pray also for
me. Thou hast consecrated thyself wholly, even from
infancy, to the love of thy God; ah, obtain for me at
least that during the remaining years of my life I may
live for God alone. To-day, together with thee, I
renounce all creatures, and consecrate myself to the
love of my Lord. I also offer myself to thee, oh my
queen, to serve thee forever. Accept me for thy
special servant, and obtain for me the grace to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_761"></a>[761]</span>
faithful to thee and to thy Son, that I may come one
day to praise thee and love thee eternally in paradise.</p>

<h5>MEDITATION FOR THE EIGHTH DAY OF DECEMBER.<br>
<i>On the Feast of the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary.</i></h5>

<p>1st. It was indeed befitting the three divine persons
to preserve Mary from original sin. It was befitting
the Father, for Mary was his first-born daughter.
As Jesus was the first-born of God: “Primogenitus
omnis creaturæ,”<a id="FNanchor_1924" href="#Footnote_1924" class="fnanchor">[1924]</a> so Mary, being destined to become
the mother of Jesus, God always considered her as his
adopted first-born daughter, and therefore always possessed
her by his grace: “Dominus possedit me in
initio viarum suarum.”<a id="FNanchor_1925" href="#Footnote_1925" class="fnanchor">[1925]</a> It was, then, befitting the
honor of the Son that the Father should preserve the
mother from every stain of sin. It was also fitting,
because he destined this his daughter to crush the
head of the infernal serpent which had seduced man,
as we read: Ipsa conteret caput tuum. How could
he then permit that she should first be his slave?
Moreover, Mary was also destined to be the advocate
of sinners; and for this reason also it was meet
that God should preserve her from sin, that she might
not appear guilty of the very sin of those for whom
she was to intercede.</p>

<p>2d. It was befitting the Son that his mother should<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_762"></a>[762]</span>
be immaculate. He chose her himself for his mother,
and it cannot be believed that a son who has
it in his power to choose a queen for his mother,
would choose a slave. How then could we believe
that the eternal Word would wish for his mother one
defiled by sin, and once an enemy of God, when it
was in his power to have an immaculate mother and
one always the friend of God? Moreover, St. Augustine
says: The flesh of Christ is the flesh of Mary:
“Caro Christi caro est Mariæ.” The Son of God
would have felt horror at taking flesh from St. Agnes,
St. Gertrude, or St. Theresa, because those holy
virgins, before baptism, were stained by sin, and the
devil would have been able to reproach him for
being clothed with a flesh which once had been subject
to him. But he felt no horror at becoming man
in the womb of Mary: “Non horruisti virginis uterum,”
Mary having always been pure and immaculate.
Besides, St. Thomas says that Mary was preserved
from every actual sin, even venial, for otherwise she
would not have been a fitting mother of God; but
how much less fit would she have been, if she had
been defiled by original sin, which renders the soul
odious to God!</p>

<p>3d. It was befitting the Holy Spirit that this his
most beloved spouse should be immaculate. The redemption
of men who had already fallen into sin being
decreed, he wished that this his spouse should be redeemed
in the most noble manner, namely, by being
preserved from falling into sin. And if God preserved<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_763"></a>[763]</span>
the body of Mary after her death, how much more
ought we to believe that he would preserve her soul
from the corruption of guilt! For this reason the
divine spouse called her an inclosed garden, a sealed
fountain (Cant.), for the enemies never entered the
blessed soul of Mary. Therefore he praised her, calling
her all fair, always beloved, and spotless. Ah,
my most lovely Lady, it is my delight to see thee so
dear to thy God through thy purity and beauty. I
thank God for having preserved thee from every sin.
Ah, my queen, since thou art so loved by the most
Holy Trinity, do not disdain to cast thy eyes upon my
soul so defiled by sin, that thou mayest obtain for me,
from God, pardon and eternal salvation. Look upon
me and change me. Thou, by thy sweetness, hast
drawn so many hearts to love thee, draw also my
heart, that henceforth I may love no other than God
and thee. Thou knowest that in thee I have placed
all my hopes; my dear mother, do not abandon me.
Assist me always by thy intercession, in life and especially
in death; make me then to die invoking thee,
and loving thee, that I may come to love thee forever
in paradise.</p>

<span class="smaller">FOR EVERY DAY OF THE WEEK.</span></h4>

</div>

<h5>SUNDAY.<br>
<i>Prayer to the most holy Mary to obtain the pardon of sins.</i></h5>

<p>Behold, oh mother of God, at thy feet a miserable
sinner, the slave of hell, who has recourse to thee,
and trusts in thee. I do not even merit that thou
shouldst look upon me, but I know that having seen
thy Son die to save sinners, thou hast the greatest
desire to aid them. Oh mother of mercy, look on my
miseries, and have pity on me. I hear thee called by
all: The refuge of sinners, the hope of the desperate,
the help of the abandoned. Then thou art my
refuge, my hope, my help. Thou must save me by
thy intercession. Succor me for the love of Jesus
Christ, give thy hand to a poor fallen sinner who recommends
himself to thee. I know that thou dost
find consolation in helping the sinner when thou canst;
help me then, for thou canst help me. I, by my sins,
have lost the grace of God and my own soul. Now
I place myself in thy hands; tell me what I must do
to return to the favor of my Lord, for I will do it
without delay. He sends me to thee, that thou
mayest succor me, and he wishes me to have recourse
to thy mercy, that not only the merits of thy Son,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_765"></a>[765]</span>
but also thy prayers may aid in my salvation. To
thee then I have recourse; thou who dost pray for
so many others, pray also to Jesus for me. Ask him
to pardon me, and he will pardon me; tell him that
thou dost desire my salvation, and he will save me.
Make known the good that thou canst do to those who
confide in thee. Amen; thus I hope, thus may it be.</p>

<h5>MONDAY.<br>
<i>Prayer to the most holy Mary to obtain holy perseverance.</i></h5>

<p>Oh queen of heaven, I who once have been a miserable
slave of Lucifer, now dedicate myself to thee,
as thy servant forever, and offer myself to honor and
serve thee for my whole life; accept me, do not refuse
me as I merit. Oh my mother, I have placed in thee
all my hopes, from thee I hope all blessings. I thank
and bless God, who in his mercy has given me this
confidence in thee, which I consider as the great
earnest of my salvation. Ah, how have I fallen in my
past life, I a miserable sinner, because I have not had
recourse to thee! Now I hope to be pardoned
through the merits of Jesus Christ, and through thy
prayers. But I may again lose the divine grace; the
danger is not over; my enemies do not sleep. How
many new temptations remain for me to conquer!
Ah, my most sweet Lady, protect me, and do not permit
me again to be their slave; help me always. I
know that thou wilt help me, and with thy help I
shall conquer, if I recommend myself to thee; but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_766"></a>[766]</span>
this I fear, that in occasions of falling into sin, I may
neglect to call on thee, and thus may be lost. This
grace I ask of thee, obtain for me that in the assaults
of hell, I may always have recourse to thee, saying:
Mary, aid me. My good mother, do not permit me to
lose my God.</p>

<h5>TUESDAY.<br>
<i>Prayer to Mary most holy to obtain a good death.</i></h5>

<p>Oh Mary, what will be my death? I tremble and
am confounded when I now consider my sins, and
think of that great, decisive moment of my salvation
or eternal damnation, when I shall die and be judged.
Oh my most sweet mother, my hopes are in the blood
of Jesus Christ, and in thy intercession. Oh consoler
of the afflicted, do not abandon me then; do not cease
consoling me in that great affliction. If now I am
tormented with remorse on account of past sins, the
uncertainty of pardon, the danger of relapse, and the
rigor of divine justice, what will become of me then?
If thou dost not aid me, I am lost. Ah, my Lady,
before my death arrives, obtain for me a great sorrow
for my sins, a true amendment, and fidelity to God
for the life that remains to me. And when the last
moment of my life comes, oh Mary my hope, aid me
then in my great distress, and encourage me then that
I may not despair at the sight of my sins which the
demon will present to me. Obtain for me the grace
to invoke thee then more constantly, that I may expire<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_767"></a>[767]</span>
with thy sweet name, and that of thy most holy Son,
upon my lips. And now, oh Lady, pardon my boldness:
before I expire come thyself to console me by
thy presence. This grace thou hast granted to so
many of thy servants, I also wish and hope for it. I
am, indeed, a sinner, and I do not merit it; but I am
thy servant, who loves thee, and has great confidence
in thee. Oh Mary, I wait for thee, do not leave me
disconsolate. At least, if I am not worthy of so great
a favor, assist me from heaven, that I may die in the
love of God and of thee, and come to love God and
thee eternally in paradise.</p>

<h5>WEDNESDAY.<br>
<i>Prayer to Mary most holy to obtain deliverance from hell.</i></h5>

<p>Oh my dearest Lady, I thank thee that thou hast
so often rescued me from hell: as often as I have deserved
it through my sins. Oh miserable sinner! I
was already condemned to that prison, and that sentence
would perhaps have been executed upon me
after my first sin, if thou hadst not in thy mercy helped
me. Thou wast not even invoked by me, but by thy
mercy alone thou hast restrained the divine justice,
and then subduing my hard-heartedness, hast drawn
me to take confidence in thee. And oh, into how
many sins I should have fallen in the dangers to which
I have been exposed, if thou, my most loving mother,
hadst not preserved me by the graces which thou
hast obtained for me! Ah, my queen, still preserve<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_768"></a>[768]</span>
me from hell. But of what avail will be thy mercy
and the favors that thou hast bestowed on me, if I
should be condemned? If once I loved thee not, now,
after God, I love thee above every thing. Ah, do not
permit that I should turn my back upon thee and upon
God, who, through thee, hath dispensed to me so
many mercies. My most amiable Lady, do not permit
that I should hate and curse thee in hell. Wilt
thou suffer a servant of thine who loves thee to be
lost? Oh Mary, what dost thou say to me? I shall
be lost if I leave thee. But who could have the heart
to leave thee? How could I forget the love thou
hast borne me? My mother, since thou hast done so
much to save me, complete the work; continue to aid
me. Dost thou wish to help me? But what do I
say? If thou didst show me so much favor when I
lived forgetful of thee, how much more ought I now
to hope, when I love thee and recommend myself to
thee! No, he who has recourse to thee is never lost;
only he who does not recommend himself to thee.
Ah, my mother, do not leave me in my own hands,
for I shall be lost; make me always to have recourse
to thee. Save me, my hope, save me from hell; but
first from sin, which alone can condemn me to hell.</p>

<h5>THURSDAY.<br>
<i>Prayer to the most holy Mary to obtain paradise.</i></h5>

<p>Oh queen of paradise, who sittest above the choirs
of angels, nearest to God; from this vale of misery I,
a miserable sinner, salute thee, and pray thee to turn<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_769"></a>[769]</span>
towards me those kind eyes of thine, that dispense
graces to all those they look upon. See, oh Mary,
in how much danger I now find myself, and must
find myself, while I live on this earth, of losing my
soul, paradise, and God. In thee, oh Lady, I have
placed all my hopes. I love thee, and long to come
to thee, see thee, and praise thee in paradise. Ah
Mary, when will the day come that I shall see myself
safe at thy feet, and shall behold the mother of my
Lord and my mother, who has been so occupied with
my salvation? When shall I kiss that hand which has
so many times delivered me from hell and bestowed
on me so many graces, when, by my sins, I merited to
be hated and abandoned by all? Oh Lady, I have
been very ungrateful to thee in my life; but if I come
to paradise I will be no more ungrateful. There I
will love thee as much as I can, every moment through
all eternity, and I will make amends for my ingratitude
by blessing thee and thanking thee forever.
Above all, I thank God who gives me such confidence
in the blood of Jesus Christ and in thee; namely, that
thou wilt save me, that thou wilt free me from my
sins, and obtain for me light and strength to execute
the divine will, and finally conduct me to the port of
paradise. All this have thy servants hoped, and none
have been deceived. Neither shall I be deceived.
Mary, I wish nothing else; thou must save me. Pray
thy Son Jesus, as I also pray him, through the merits
of his passion, to preserve in me, and always more increase
this confidence, and I shall be saved.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_770"></a>[770]</span></p>

<h5>FRIDAY.<br>
<i>Prayer to the most holy Mary to obtain love towards her and
Jesus Christ.</i></h5>

<p>Oh Mary, I know that thou art the creature the
most noble, the most sublime, the most pure, the most
beautiful, the most merciful, the most holy; in a
word, the most lovely of all creatures. Oh, if all
knew thee, oh my Lady, and loved thee as thou dost
merit! But I console myself that so many happy
souls in heaven and on earth live enamored of thy
goodness and beauty. Above all, I rejoice that God
himself loves thee alone more than all men and angels
united. My most amiable queen, I, a miserable sinner,
also love thee, but I love thee too little: I desire
a love greater and more tender towards thee; and
this thou must obtain for me, for to love thee is a
great sign of predestination, and a grace that God
does not grant except to those whom he wishes to be
saved.</p>

<p>I see myself then, oh my mother, greatly indebted
to thy Son. I see that he merits an infinite love.
Thou who desirest nothing but to see him loved, this
is the grace that above all others thou must obtain
for me; obtain for me a great love for Jesus Christ.
Thou dost obtain from God whatever thou dost wish;
ah, obtain for me this grace, to be so united with the
divine will that I may never more be separated from
it. I do not ask of thee the goods of earth, neither<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_771"></a>[771]</span>
honors nor riches; I ask of thee what thy heart most
desires, I wish to love my God. Is it possible that
thou wilt not aid me in this my desire, which pleases
thee so much? No, for thou dost even now help me,
already thou art praying for me; pray, pray, and
never cease to pray until thou seest me in paradise,
beyond the danger of being able any more to lose my
Lord, and certain of loving him forever, together with
thee, my dearest mother.</p>

<h5>SATURDAY.<br>
<i>Prayer to the most holy Mary to obtain her patronage.</i></h5>

<p>Oh my most holy mother, I know what graces thou
hast obtained for me, and I see the ingratitude of
which I have been guilty towards thee. The ungrateful
are no longer worthy of favors; but I will not on
this account distrust thy mercy, which is greater than
my ingratitude. Oh my great advocate, have pity on
me. Thou art the dispenser of all the graces which
God grants to us miserable sinners, and for this end
he has made thee so powerful, so rich, and so merciful,
that thou mightest succor us in our miseries. Ah,
mother of mercy, do not leave me in my poverty.
Thou art the advocate of the most wretched and abandoned
sinners who have recourse to thee, defend me
also, who recommend myself to thee. Do not tell me
that it is difficult to gain my cause, for the most desperate
causes are all gained when they are defended
by thee. In thy hands, then, I place my eternal salvation,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_772"></a>[772]</span>
and to thee I commit my soul. It was lost;
thou, by thy intercession, must save it. I wish to be
enrolled among thy most devoted servants; do not
cast me out: thou dost go in search of the wretched
to relieve them; do not abandon a miserable sinner
who has recourse to thee. Speak for me; thy Son
does whatever thou dost ask of him. Take me under
thy protection, and this will be enough: yes, for if
thou dost protect me I fear nothing; nothing from my
sins, for thou wilt obtain for me the remedy for the
injury I have inflicted upon myself; nor from the
demons, for thou art more powerful than all hell
united; nor from Jesus my Judge himself, for by one
prayer of thine he is appeased. I only fear that
through my negligence I may cease to invoke thee,
and shall thus be lost. My mother, obtain for me the
pardon of all my sins, love to Jesus, holy perseverance,
a good death, and finally, paradise; especially obtain
for me the grace always to recommend myself to thee.
It is true that these graces are too much for me who
do not merit them, but they are not too much for thee
who art so much beloved by God that he grants thee
whatever thou dost ask of him. It is enough that
thou dost begin to speak, and he denies thee nothing.
Pray then to Jesus for me, tell him that thou dost
protect me, and he will not fail to have pity on me.
My mother, I trust in thee; in this hope I repose and
live, and in this I wish to die. Amen.</p>

<p>Live alway, Jesus our love and Mary our hope!</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" id="LITTLE_ROSARY_OF_THE_SEVEN_DOLORS_OF_MARY">LITTLE ROSARY OF THE SEVEN DOLORS OF MARY.</h4>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Incline unto mine aid, oh God, &amp;c.</p>

<p>My mother, enable my heart to share thy sorrow for the death
of thy Son.</p>

</div>

<p><i>First Dolor.</i>—I pity thee, oh my afflicted mother,
on account of the first sword of sorrow that pierced
thee, when in the temple, by the prophecy of St.
Simeon, all the cruel sufferings that men would inflict
on thy beloved Jesus were represented to thee, which
thou hadst already learned from the holy Scriptures,
even to his death before thy eyes upon the infamous
wood of the cross, exhausted of blood and abandoned
by all, and thou without the power to defend or relieve
him. By that bitter memory, then, which for so
many years afflicted thy heart, I pray thee, oh my
queen, to obtain for me the grace that always in life
and in death I may keep impressed upon my heart
the passion of Jesus and thy sorrows.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Our Father, Hail Mary, Glory be to God, &amp;c., Oh my mother,
&amp;c., as above. Which strophe must always be repeated at the
end of each dolor.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Second Dolor.</i>—I pity thee, oh my afflicted mother,
on account of the second sword that pierced thee
when thou didst behold thy innocent Son, so soon after
his birth, threatened with death by those very men<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_774"></a>[774]</span>
for whom he had come into the world; so that thou
wast obliged to flee with him by night secretly into
Egypt. By the many hardships, then, that thou, a
delicate young virgin, in company with thy exiled infant,
didst endure in the long and wearisome journey
through rough and desert countries, and in thy sojourn
in Egypt, where, being unknown and a stranger, thou
didst live all those years poor and despised, I pray
thee, oh my beloved Lady, to obtain for me the grace
to suffer with patience, in thy company till death, the
trials of this miserable life, that I may be able in the
next to be preserved from the eternal sufferings of
hell deserved by me. Our Father, &amp;c.</p>

<p><i>Third Dolor.</i>—I pity thee, oh my afflicted mother,
on account of the third sword that pierced thy heart at
the loss of thy dear son, Jesus, who remained absent
from thee in Jerusalem for three days, when not seeing
thy beloved one by thy side, and not knowing the
cause of his absence, I conceive, my loving queen, how
in these nights thou didst not repose, and didst naught
but sigh for him who was thy only good. By the
sighs, then, of those three days, for thee so long and
bitter, I pray thee to obtain for me the grace never
to lose my God; that I may always live closely united
to God, and thus united with him depart from this
world. Our Father, &amp;c.</p>

<p><i>Fourth Dolor.</i>—I pity thee, my afflicted mother, on
account of the fourth sword that pierced thy heart, in
seeing thy Jesus condemned to death, bound with
ropes and chains, covered with blood and wounds,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_775"></a>[775]</span>
crowned with thorns, and falling under the weight of
the heavy cross which he bore on his bleeding back
when going like an innocent lamb to die for love of us.
Thine eye then met his eye, and your glances were so
many cruel arrows with which each wounded the loving
heart of the other. By this great grief, then, I
pray thee to obtain for me the grace to live wholly resigned
to the will of my God, joyfully bearing my
cross with Jesus to the last moment of my life. Our
Father, &amp;c.</p>

<p><i>Fifth Dolor.</i>—I pity thee, oh my afflicted mother, on
account of the fifth sword that pierced thy heart, when
on Mount Calvary thou didst behold thy beloved son,
Jesus, dying slowly before thy eyes, amid so many insults,
and in anguish, on that hard bed of the cross, without
being able to give him even the least of those comforts
which the greatest criminals receive at the hour
of death. And I pray thee by the anguish which thou,
oh my most loving mother, didst suffer together with
thy dying Son, and by the tenderness thou didst feel
when, for the last time, he spoke to thee from the
cross, and taking leave of thee, left all of us to thee
in the person of St. John, as thy children; and thou,
still constant, didst behold him bow his head and expire;
I pray thee to obtain for me the grace, by
thy crucified love, to live and die crucified to every
thing in this world, in order to live only to God through
my whole life, and thus to enter one day paradise, to
enjoy him face to face. Our Father, &amp;c.</p>

<p><i>Sixth Dolor.</i>—I pity thee, oh my afflicted mother,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_776"></a>[776]</span>
on account of the sixth sword which pierced thy heart,
when thou didst see the kind heart of thy Son pierced
through and through after his death—a death endured
for those ungrateful men, who, even after his death,
were not satisfied with the tortures they had inflicted
upon him. By this cruel sorrow, then, which was
wholly thine, I pray thee to obtain for me the grace
to abide in the heart of Jesus, who was wounded and
opened for me; in that heart, I say, which is the beautiful
abode of love, where all the souls who love God
repose; and that living there, I may never love or
think of any thing but God. Most holy Virgin, thou
canst do it; from thee I hope for it. Our Father, &amp;c.</p>

<p><i>Seventh Dolor.</i>—I pity thee, my afflicted mother, on
account of the seventh sword that pierced thy heart, on
seeing in thy arms thy Son who had just expired, no
longer fair and beautiful as thou didst once receive
him in the stable of Bethlehem, but covered with blood,
livid, and lacerated by wounds which exposed his very
bones. My Son, thou saidst, my Son, to what has
love brought thee? And when he was borne to the
sepulchre, thou didst wish to accompany him thyself,
and help to put him in the tomb with thy own hands;
and, bidding him a last farewell, thou hast left thy
loving heart buried with thy Son. By all the anguish
of thy pure soul, obtain for me, oh mother of fair love,
pardon for the offences that I have committed against
my God, whom I love, and of which I repent with my
whole heart. Wilt thou defend me in temptations?
Assist me at the hour of my death, that, being saved<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_777"></a>[777]</span>
by the merits of Jesus and thine, I may come one day,
with thy aid, after this miserable exile, to sing in paradise
the praises of Jesus and thine through all eternity.
Amen. Our Father, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Pray for us, oh most sorrowful Virgin;</p>

<p>That we may be worthy of the promises of Christ.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Let us Pray.</i></p>

<p>Oh God, at whose passion, according to the prophecy
of Simeon, the sword of sorrow pierced through
the most sweet soul of the glorious virgin and mother,
Mary, grant that we, who commemorate and reverence
her dolors, may experience the blessed effect of thy passion,
who livest and reignest world without end. Amen.</p>

<p class="tb">Benedict XIII. granted two hundred days’ indulgence
for every “Our Father” and every “Hail Mary”
to those who recite this little crown in the churches of
the Servites of Mary, and has granted the same favor
to those who recite it in any place whatever on Fridays
or any day during Lent; and on other days, one hundred

<h4 class="nobreak" id="PRAYERS">VARIOUS PRAYERS TO MARY.</h4>

</div>

<h5>Dedication of oneself to Mary.</h5>

<p>Oh most holy virgin mother of God, Mary, I, N.,
although most unworthy of being thy servant, yet
moved by thy wonderful mercy and by the desire to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_779"></a>[779]</span>
serve thee, choose thee to-day, in presence of my
guardian angel, and of the whole celestial court, for
my especial Lady, Advocate, and Mother, and make
the firm resolution that I always will love and serve
thee for the future, and do whatever I can to induce
others also to love and serve thee. I pray thee,
mother of God, and my most kind and amiable mother,
by the blood of thy divine Son which was shed for
me, that thou wilt receive me into the number of thy
servants for thy child and servant forever; assist me
in all my thoughts, words, and actions, at every moment
of my life, that every step and breath may be
directed to the greater glory of my God, and through
thy most powerful intercession obtain for me that I
may never more offend my beloved Jesus, that I may
glorify and love him in this life, and that I may also
love thee, my most beloved and dear mother, that I
may love thee and enjoy thee through eternity in holy
paradise. Amen.</p>

<p>My mother Mary, I recommend to thee my soul,
especially at the hour of my death.</p>

<h5>Dedication of a Family to Mary.</h5>

<p>Oh blessed and immaculate Virgin, our queen and
mother, refuge and consolation of all those who are in
misery, I, prostrate before thy throne with all my
family, choose thee for my Lady, Mother, and Advocate
with God. I, with all who belong to me, dedicate
myself forever to thy service, and pray thee, oh mother
of God, to receive us into the number of thy servants,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_780"></a>[780]</span>
taking us all under thy protection, aiding us in life,
and still more, at the hour of our death. Oh mother
of mercy, I choose thee Lady and ruler of my whole
house, of my relatives, my interests, and all my affairs.
Do not disdain to take care of them; dispose of them
all as it pleases thee. Bless me, then, and all my
family, and do not permit that any of us should offend
thy Son. Do thou defend us in temptations, deliver
us from dangers, provide for us in our necessities,
counsel us in our doubts, console us in afflictions, be
with us in sickness, and especially in the agonies of
death. Do not permit the devil to glory in having in
his chains any of us who are now consecrated to thee;
but grant that we may come to thee in heaven to
thank thee, and together with thee to praise and love
our Redeemer Jesus for all eternity. Amen, thus
may it be.</p>

<h5>Prayer of St. Ephrem to Mary, abbreviated.<a id="FNanchor_1927" href="#Footnote_1927" class="fnanchor">[1927]</a></h5>

<p>Oh immaculate and wholly pure Virgin Mary,
mother of God, queen of the world, hope of the despairing;
thou art the joy of the saints, thou art the
reconciler of sinners to God, thou art the advocate of
the abandoned, the secure haven of the shipwrecked;
thou art the consolation of the world, the ransom of
captives, the comforter of the afflicted, the salvation
of the world. Oh great queen, we take refuge in thy
protection. We confide in none but thee, oh most
pure Virgin: Non nobis est alia quam in te fiducia, O<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_781"></a>[781]</span>
Virgo sincerissima. Oh Lady, after God we have no
other hope but in thee. We bear the name of thy
servants, do not permit the enemy to bear us away to
hell. Hail, best mediatrix of God and men: Ave,
Dei et hominum mediatrix optima. I salute thee, oh
great mediatrix of peace between men and God; oh
mother of Jesus our Lord, the love of all men and of
God; to thee be honor and blessing with the Father
and with the Holy Spirit. Amen.</p>

<h5>Prayer of St. Thomas of Aquin.</h5>

<p>Oh most blessed and sweet Virgin Mary, full of
compassion, I recommend to thy mercy my soul and
my body, my thoughts, my works, my life, and my
death. Oh my Lady, help me and make me strong
against the snares of the devil; obtain for me a true
and perfect love, with which I may love with all my
heart thy most beloved Son, and my Lord Jesus
Christ; and after him may I love thee above all things.
Oh my queen and mother, with thy most powerful
intercession make this love to remain with me until
death, after which may I be conducted by thee to the
country of the blessed.<a id="FNanchor_1928" href="#Footnote_1928" class="fnanchor">[1928]</a></p>

<h5>Prayer of St. Blosius to the Blessed Virgin.</h5>

<p>Hail, Mary, hope of the despairing, help of the
destitute, to whom thy Son pays so great honor that
whatever thou dost ask thou dost at once obtain, whatever
thou dost wish is at once done. To thee are committed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_782"></a>[782]</span>
the treasures of the celestial kingdom. Grant,
oh Lady, that amid the storms of this life, I may always
turn my eyes to thee. To thy mercy I commend
my soul and my body. Direct and protect me at every
hour and every moment, oh my sweet protectress.</p>

<h5>Another Prayer.</h5>

<p>Hail, most compassionate mother of mercy; hail,
consolation and pardon, Mary most desired. Who
shall not love thee? Thou our light in doubt, our
consolation in sorrow, our relief in distress, our refuge
in perils and temptations, thou, after thy only-begotten
Son, art our secure salvation. Blessed are those who
love thee, oh Lady. Incline, I pray thee, thy ear of
mercy to the prayers of this thy servant, this miserable
sinner, and dissipate the darkness of my vices by the
rays of thy sanctity, that I may please thee.<a id="FNanchor_1929" href="#Footnote_1929" class="fnanchor">[1929]</a></p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="ACCLAMATIONS_IN_PRAISE_OF_MARY">ACCLAMATIONS IN PRAISE OF MARY.</h3>

</div>

<p>Oh most holy Virgin Mary! oh queen of angels!
how complete and perfect heaven has created thee!
Oh, that I might appear in the eyes of God, as thou
dost appear to me! Thou art so beautiful and lovely,
that with thy beauty thou dost ravish hearts. When
thou dost appear, every thing appears deformed, every
beauty is eclipsed, every grace disappears, precisely
as the stars disappear at the rising of the sun.</p>

<p>Thy great servant, St. John Damascene, contemplated
thee; and when he saw thee so lovely, it appeared
to him thou hadst taken the flower and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_786"></a>[786]</span>
best of every creature, and therefore he called thee:
The comeliness of nature: “Naturæ venustatem;”
the grace and comeliness of all creatures. St. Augustine,
the brightest light of the Doctors, gazed on thee,
and thou didst appear to him so beautiful and lovely,
that he called thee the form and countenance of God,
and it did not seem to him adulation: Thou art worthy
of being called the form of God: “Si formam Dei te
appellem digna existis.” Thy devout servant, Albertus
Magnus, contemplated thee, and it seemed to him
that all the graces and gifts that were found in the
most celebrated women of the ancient dispensation
were all surpassed in thee. The golden mouth of
Sara, when with thy smile thou makest heaven and
earth joyful; the tender and sweet glance of the
fruitful Lia, with which thou dost soften the heart of
God inexorable to sinners; the splendor of the countenance
of the beautiful Rachel, as thou dost obscure
the sun by thy radiant beauty; the grace and the
comeliness of the discreet Abigail, with which thou
dost appease the wrath of an angry God; the fire and
strength of the brave Judith, when thou dost powerfully
and graciously subdue the proudest hearts.</p>

<p>In a word, sovereign princess, from the vast ocean
of thy beauty flowed forth, like streams, the beauty
and grace of all creatures. The sea learned to curl
its waves, and wave its crystals, from the golden locks
of thy head, which, curling gracefully, floated upon
thy shoulders and ivory neck. The crystal fountains,
and their clear depths, learned their quiet and steady<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_787"></a>[787]</span>
flow from the serenity of thy beautiful brow and thy
placid countenance. The graceful bow, when it is
most beautiful, has carefully learned from thy eyebrow
to arch itself gracefully, that it may better dart forth
its rays of light. The morning Dian and the gentle
Hesperus are flashes from thy radiant eyes. The
white lily and the ruddy rose have stolen their colors
from thy cheeks. The envious purple and coral sigh
for the ruby of thy lips. The purest milk and sweetest
honey are distillations from the sweet honeycomb of thy
mouth. The odorous jasmin and the fragrant rose of
Damascus have stolen their perfumes from thy breath.
The loftiest cedar and the finest and most erect cypress
esteem themselves happy when they see that they are
the image of thy straight and lofty neck, and the palm-tree
enviously, and in emulation, imitates thy stately
stature. And thus, oh Lady, every created beauty
is the shadow and copy of thy beauty. Therefore I
do not wonder, oh sovereign princess, that heaven and
earth are placed under thy feet; for they are so small
and thou so great, that when thy feet only rest upon
them they are enriched, and they deem themselves
happy and blessed when they can kiss them: so the
moon when St. John the Evangelist saw her at thy
feet. And the splendor of the sun was increased,
when thou didst clothe thyself with his rays. The
Evangelist, blinded by the greatness of thy light, was
lost in wonder, and beside himself at the sight of so
stupendous a miracle of beauty, in which the beauty
of heaven and earth was contained, and he said: And<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_788"></a>[788]</span>
there appeared a great sign in heaven: “Signum magnum
apparuit in cœlo.” There appeared a great
wonder in heaven, that amazed the angels and terrified
the earth. And that miracle was a woman clothed
from head to foot with light and splendor, whom the
resplendent sun chose for his mother, and he placed
himself in her womb, and to her the fair moon serves
as a robe encircled with silver, and innumerable stars
crown her temples, and are emulous of encircling her
locks, and adorn her head with a wreath of precious
gems: And on her head a crown of twelve stars:
“Et in capite ejus corona duodecim stellarum.”</p>

<p>And thus the saints, oh most sacred Virgin, marvelling
at so great splendor which surpasses the brightness
of the sun, and the graceful loveliness of the moon,
though they be the perfect flower and ideal of all
beauty, and considering the acclamations that burst
forth from the heavens, never ceased to admire thy
beauty, and do nothing but exclaim, and extol thee
also, with acclamations of wonder and amazement.
St. Peter Damian, paying to thee his homage, says:
“Oh holy, and most holy of all the saints, and the
richest treasure of all sanctity!” And St. Bernard:
“Oh admirable Virgin! Oh woman, the glory of all
other women! The best and greatest that the world
has ever possessed!” St. Epiphanius: “Oh heaven
more vast and extended than the empyrean! Virgin
truly full of grace!” And the Catholic Church, in
the name of all, sings: “Oh most clement, most merciful,
oh always sweet Virgin Mary!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_789"></a>[789]</span></p>

<p>And I also, oh heavenly princess, with thy leave,
although I am the least of thy servants, I also wish
to make my acclamations of wonder and amazement.
Oh gracious and beautiful heaven, more vast than the
empyrean! since in this the immensity of God is not
contained, but he was even concealed in thy womb.
Oh richest treasure, in which was deposited the most
rich jewel of our redemption! Oh mother of sinners,
beneath thy mantle we are protected! Oh consolation
of the world, in whom all the afflicted, infirm,
and disconsolate find comfort! Oh beautiful eyes,
that ravish hearts! Oh coral lips, that take souls
captive! Oh beneficent hands, filled with hyacinths,
that are always dispensing graces! Oh pure creature,
who dost appear so like God, and whom I should
have esteemed a God, if faith had not taught me that
thou art not God, although thou hast a splendor and I
know not what of supreme Deity! Oh great Lady,
empress of heaven, enjoy for a thousand eternities the
grandeur of thy state, the immensity of thy graces,
and the felicity of thy glory. Only I supplicate thee,
oh compassionate mother, that thou wilt not forget us,
who beg to be thy servants and children. And because
thou art the depositary of all graces, and the
best and most privileged of all created things, obtain
for us thy servants, oh Lady, that we may be favored
far more than any others in the world. And may all
the world know that the dear children of Mary are
the best of heaven and earth; the beloved children
who are tenderly cared for, and enjoy the best that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_790"></a>[790]</span>
such a mother has to give; the well-beloved, who are
caressed in the bosom of the queen of heaven, and
are doubly favored and doubly caressed by thy majesty.
Thus I hope, oh most beautiful Rachel! and
thus I trust thou wilt do, oh sovereign princess! In
the name of what thou art; do it, for all heaven prostrate
at thy feet, is supplicating and praying thee for
this. Consent; utter but one loving <i>fiat</i>; <i>fiat, fiat</i>;
be it done, be it done. Oh man, what art thou doing?
How dost thou love the creatures of earth, deceitful and
lying creatures, who betray and make thee lose thy
soul, thy body, paradise, and God? And why not
love Mary, the most loving, the most amiable, and the
most faithful, who, after enriching thee with consolations
and graces in this life, will obtain for thee, from
her divine Son, the eternal glory of paradise? Oh
Mary, Mary, beautiful above all creatures! lovely,
next to Jesus, above all loves! dearer than all created
things! more graceful than all graces! have pity on
my miserable heart. Miserable because it ought to
love thee and does not love thee. Thou canst kindle
it with thy holy love. Turn, oh Mary, thy loving eyes
upon me, look on me, draw me to thyself, and obtain
that, next to God, I may love none but thee, oh most
gracious, most amiable Mary, mother of Jesus, and
my mother.</p>
